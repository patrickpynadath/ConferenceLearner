The CMI contribution is studied in two scenarios: i) perfect CMI available to the transmitter and ii) only CMI statistics known at the transmitter. Under these two scenarios, using the quantized CDI and quantization error statistics, we propose a unified approach to design the VP precoders that minimize the mean square error (MSE) between channel input and output. Closed-form expressions to the precoders are then derived.

In addition, the large memory capacity and channel bandwidth requirements for the storage and transmission of visual data necessitate the use of compression techniques. Vector quantization (VQ) is an efficient technique for low bit-rate image and video compression. In addition, the low complexity of the decoder makes VQ attractive for low power systems and applications which require fast decoding. In this paper, we present an indexing technique for compressed video using vector quantization. Here, a video sequence is first compressed using VQ. Each frame is represented by a usage map, a set of VQ labels, and a set of motion vectors. The video sequence is partitioned into shots and the various camera operations and motion within each shot are then determined by processing the VQ label maps. Each shot is indexed using a spatio-temporal index. The spatial index refers to the spatial content of the representative frame of a shot, while the temporal index represents the temporal content of the shot. The spatial index is based on the codewords used to compress the representative frame, while the temporal index is based on motion and camera operations within the shot. The proposed indexing technique is executed entirely in the compressed domain. This entails significant savings in computational and storage costs resulting in faster execution.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.633489","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=633489","","Indexing;Video sequences;Video compression;Image coding;Vector quantization;Decoding;Cameras;Spatial indexes;Database systems;Image databases","vector quantisation;video coding;image sequences;image representation;motion estimation;visual databases","spatio-temporal indexing;vector quantized video sequences;visual database systems;large memory capacity;channel bandwidth;compression techniques;indexing technique;low power systems;fast decoding;motion vectors;spatio-temporal index;computational costs;storage costs;motion estimation;MPEG;video processing","","8","6","33","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The quantization of the variance vectors is done using an information theoretic distortion measure. Closed form expressions are given for the computation of the VQ codebook and the superiority of the proposed distortion measure over the Euclidean distance is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown using the connected TI digits database and a noisy version of it. For the connected TI digit database, the proposed method shows that by quantizing the variance to 16 levels we can maintain recognition performance within 1% degradation of the original VR system.

In contrast, P-frames are highly compressed and therefore have less capacity. However, P-frames occur more frequently; thus, for applicable video watermarking it is desirable to exploit P-frames too. This paper explores the capacity of P-frames for watermark embedding utilizing just the syntactic elements of the compressed video. The limited level of robustness and quality degradations are some of the main challenges in embedding the watermark in P-frames. In the proposed method, the motion information of the video sequences is analyzed to find appropriate selections; then, nonzero quantized residuals are utilized for watermark embedding.

The usefulness of the representation scheme is demonstrated by using it as a data preprocessing unit attached to the well-known least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) for application on big data sets. Essentially, the proposed DQS adopts a single shrinkage threshold to obtain a simple quantization scheme, which adapts its outputs to input data density. With this quantization scheme, a large data set is quantized to a small subset where considerable sample size reduction is generally obtained. In particular, the sample size reduction can save significant computational cost when using the quantized subset for feature approximation via the Nyström method. Based on the quantized subset, the approximated features are incorporated into LS-SVM to develop a data density-dependent quantized LS-SVM (DQLS-SVM), where an analytic solution is obtained in the primal solution space. The developed DQLS-SVM is evaluated on synthetic and benchmark data with particular emphasis on large data sets.

A novel precoding vector quantization scheme is applied to the prediction filter in the precoder and is shown to provide comparable results to the LMS adaptation algorithm while reducing the overheads.","1558-2558","","10.1109/4234.848411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848411","","Frequency;Decision feedback equalizers;Filters;Land mobile radio;Bandwidth;Constellation diagram;Vector quantization;Least squares approximation;Bit rate;Radio transmitters","adaptive codes;vector quantisation;land mobile radio;digital radio;prediction theory;filtering theory;Rayleigh channels;multipath channels;adaptive signal processing","adaptive vector quantized flexible precoder;dynamic continuous frequency selective mobile channel;bandwidth efficient techniques;public mobile radio communication systems;nonlinear pre-equalization;decision-feedback equalizer;DFE;digital mobile channel;dynamic channel characteristics;precoding vector quantization;prediction filter;LMS adaptation algorithm;overhead reduction;VQ;Rayleigh fading;multipath channel","","1","1","12","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, vision based robotic grasp detection is hindered by the unavailability of sufficient labelled data. Furthermore, the application of semi-supervised learning techniques to grasp detection is underexplored. In this paper, a semi-supervised learning based grasp detection approach has been presented, which models a discrete latent space using a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) has been applied in the domain of robotic grasp detection. The VAE helps the model in generalizing beyond the Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD) despite having a limited amount of labelled data by also utilizing the unlabelled data. This claim has been validated by testing the model on images, which are not available in the CGD. Along with this, we augment the Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network (GGCNN) architecture with the decoder structure used in the VQ-VAE model with the intuition that it should help to regress in the vector-quantized latent space. Subsequently, the model performs significantly better than the existing approaches which do not make use of unlabelled images to improve the grasp.","2474-915X","978-1-7281-8895-9","10.1109/SPCOM50965.2020.9179578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179578","Grasp Rectangle;Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE);Generative Grasp Convolutional Neural Network (GGCNN)","Task analysis;Training data;Grasping;Decoding;Robot kinematics;Data models","control engineering computing;convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;object detection;robot vision;vector quantisation","complex manipulation tasks;vision based robotic grasp detection;semisupervised learning techniques;vector quantized variational autoencoder;Cornell grasping dataset;VQ-VAE model;vector-quantized latent space;robotic grasp detection;learning representation;generative grasping convolutional neural network architecture","","3","","19","","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The principle of vector quantization is utilized for quantizing the instantaneous reference voltage space vector in the proposed space-vector-based sigma-delta converter. The switching vectors of the inverter are naturally selected without sector identification, ensuring optimum switching sequence under all conditions including the overmodulation region. As the sigma-delta converter results in a randomly varying switching frequency, the proposed scheme has spread spectrum characteristics. To avoid fractional arithmetic, a 60° coordinate system is used to represent the space vector in this paper. The proposed scheme can be used for any general n -level inverter, and experimental results are presented for four-, five-, and six-level inverters, driving a 2-hp three-phase induction motor in an open-end winding configuration.

A simple Normalization of data in the scale [0, 1] without attributing special importance to specific sub-intervals in [0, 1] results in significant loss in information, which cannot be retrieved otherwise to identify the proposer class of a given data point. This paper attempts to represent n-dimensional data point patterns into quantized fuzzy vectors of 3n dimensions. As the class information for all the data points of the training instances are known, a majority voting over (the individual quantized fuzzy) components of the data points in a class effectively returns an approximate centroidal measure of the data points lying in the same class. The concatenation of such majority-voted components of the data points in a class represents the class centroid of the respective class. The class centroids thus obtained are saved to determine the class of an unknown data point. The classification of an unknown data point here is performed in two steps. First the unknown data point is quantized in fuzzy space similarly as for the training data, and the resulting quantized fuzzy vector is projected along all the unit class centroid vectors of all known classes. In case the projection along the k-th unit class centroid vector is the largest, then the class of the unknown data point is regarded as k. The proposed principle has successfully been applied in classification of olfactory stimuli from the acquired EEG signals of the subjects and the classification performance is found to be superior with respect to the existing state-of-the art algorithms.","","978-1-5386-5906-9","10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944662","Fuzzy vector quantization;olfactory perception;classification;electroencephalography","Training;Electroencephalography;Fuzzy sets;Vector quantization;Feature extraction;Olfactory","brain;electroencephalography;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal detection;medical signal processing;signal classification;vector quantisation;vectors","acquired EEG signals;majority-voted components;acquired brain signals;olfactory stimuli;quantized fuzzy vector;unit class centroid vector;training data;quantized fuzzy vectors;n-dimensional data point patterns;fuzzy vector quantization","","1","","21","","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed for lattice VQ to be competitive, the quantized vectors should be entropy coded. This has traditionally been performed on a per image basis, a complex and inefficient process.

In addition, uncertain nonlinearity and the unknown stochastic disturbances are simultaneously considered in the quantized feedback control systems. By putting forward a new nonlinear decomposition of the quantized input, the relationship between the control signal and the quantized signal is established, as a result, the major technique difficulty arising from the piece-wise quantized input is overcome. Based on fuzzy logic systems' universal approximation capability, a novel fuzzy adaptive tracking controller is constructed via backstepping technique.

In the past few years, several highly successful techniques for recognizing spoken connected digit strings have been proposed. Although these techniques have been applied to non-telephone based speech [e.g. Texas Instruments database], they have produced high recognition performance. Further, similar levels of performances have been demonstrated using discrete density and continuous density based hidden Markov models (HMMs). The success of the vector quantized (VQ) modeling approach, in particular, is encouraging and rather important from the viewpoint of computational efficiency. This paper presents a study of connected digit recognition on telephone network based data using VQ HMMs. We investigate several factors affecting the error rate of VQ HMMs-such as maximum mutual information (MMI) training, sender modeling, and codebook size-and measure their contributions to recognition accuracy.

These effects are investigated in two settings: frame expansions (representations obtained by forming inner products with each element of the set) and matching pursuit expansions (approximations obtained by greedily forming linear combinations). In both cases, based on the concept of consistency, it is shown that traditional linear reconstruction methods are suboptimal, and better consistent reconstruction algorithms are given. The proposed consistent reconstruction algorithms were in each case implemented, and experimental results are included. For frame expansions, results are proven to bound distortion as a function of frame redundancy r and quantization step size for linear, consistent, and optimal reconstruction methods. Taken together, these suggest that optimal reconstruction methods will yield O(1/r/sup 2/) mean-squared error (MSE), and that consistency is sufficient to insure this asymptotic behavior. A result on the asymptotic tightness of random frames is also proven. Applicability of quantized matching pursuit to lossy vector compression is explored. Experiments demonstrate the likelihood that a linear reconstruction is inconsistent, the MSE reduction obtained with a nonlinear (consistent) reconstruction algorithm, and generally competitive performance at low bit rates.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.650985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=650985","","Algorithm design and analysis;Reconstruction algorithms;Vectors;Quantization;Signal processing algorithms;Matching pursuit algorithms;Acoustic distortion;Nonlinear distortion;Redundancy;Bit rate","vector quantisation;source coding;signal reconstruction;random processes;signal representation","quantized overcomplete expansions;IR/sup N/;analysis;synthesis;algorithms;vector representations;frame expansions;inner products;matching pursuit expansions;linear combinations;suboptimal linear reconstruction methods;distortion;frame redundancy;quantization step size;O(1/r/sup 2/) mean-squared error;asymptotic behavior;asymptotic tightness;random frames;lossy vector compression;MSE reduction;source coding;signal processing","","283","5","35","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Coupled with state constraints and fast dynamics, explicit model predictive control (EMPC) provides an attractive control formalism. However, the design of data-driven EMPCs with finite admissible control sets is a challenging and relatively unexplored problem. In this paper, a systematic data-driven method is proposed for the design of quantized EMPCs (Q-EMPCs) for time-varying output tracking in nonlinear systems. The design involves: 1) sampling the admissible state space using low-discrepancy sequences to provide scalability to higher dimensional nonlinear systems; 2) at each sampled data point, solving for optimal quantized model predictive control actions and determining feasibility of the intrinsic mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem; and 3) constructing the Q-EMPC control surface using multiclass support vector machines (MC-SVMs). In particular, four widely used MC-SVM algorithms are employed to construct the proposed data-driven Q-EMPC. Extensive testing and comparison among the different MC-SVM algorithms is performed on 2-D and 5-D benchmark examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methodology.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2016.2638401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7779123","Explicit nonlinear model predictive control;finite control set;multicategory learning;output tracking;supervised learning;support vector machines (SVMs)","Support vector machines;Nonlinear systems;Scalability;Predictive models;Predictive control;Programming;Training","digital control;integer programming;nonlinear control systems;nonlinear programming;predictive control;support vector machines;time-varying systems","output-tracking quantized explicit nonlinear model;multiclass support vector machines;digital control;explicit model predictive control;finite admissible control;quantized EMPC;Q-EMPC;time-varying output tracking;nonlinear systems;mixed-integer nonlinear programming","","15","","48","IEEE","9 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The vector quantization problem is studied in such a distributed estimation context. Specifically, our study focuses on a class of hyperplane-based vector quantizers which linearly convert the observation vector into a scalar by using a compression vector and then carry out a scalar quantization.

This algorithm also accounts for the residual redundancy left at the vector quantizer output. The results obtained using this approach are compared to the results obtained by using a hard decision VQ decoder. Also, this decoder is used in conjunction with a channel optimized vector quantizer (COVQ), which is designed using a nonrecursive symbol by symbol detector instead of the optimal MAP symbol by symbol detector, thus reducing the dimensionality considerably. We also introduce simplified design procedure, obtained by determining the channel transition matrix of an equivalent discrete memoryless channel, and then applying well known COVQ procedures for discrete memoryless channels. We find that the soft decision decoder considerably improves reconstruction fidelity at low channel SNR's, and that COVQ further improves the performance.","","0-7803-2486-2","10.1109/ICC.1995.524440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=524440","","Gaussian channels;Decoding;Detectors;AWGN;Redundancy;Memoryless systems;Additive white noise;Intersymbol interference;Design optimization;Vector quantization","vector quantisation;Gaussian channels;signal reconstruction;Markov processes;maximum likelihood estimation;approximation theory;matrix algebra;decoding","Gaussian channels;memory channels;vector quantization;vector quantized Markov source;maximum a posteriori algorithm;symbol-by-symbol algorithm;soft decision VQ decoder;minimum mean-squared error estimate;source vectors;residual redundancy;vector quantizer output;hard decision VQ decoder;channel optimized vector quantizer;nonrecursive symbol by symbol detector;design procedure;channel transition matrix;discrete memoryless channel;reconstruction fidelity;low channel SNR;performance","","12","1","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contrary to the previous work, a generalized attack model is employed which manipulates the data using transformations with arbitrary functional forms determined by some attack parameters whose values are unknown to the attacked system. For the first time, necessary and sufficient conditions are provided under which the transformations provide a guaranteed attack performance in terms of Cramer–Rao Bound (CRB) regardless of the processing the estimation system employs, thus defining a highly desirable attack. Interestingly, these conditions imply that, for any such attack when the attacked sensors can be perfectly identified by the estimation system, either the Fisher information matrix (FIM) for jointly estimating the desired and attack parameters is singular or that the attacked system is unable to improve the CRB for the desired vector parameter through this joint estimation even though the joint FIM is nonsingular. It is shown that it is always possible to construct such a highly desirable attack by properly employing a sufficiently large dimension attack vector parameter relative to the number of quantization levels employed, which was not observed previously. To illustrate the theory in a concrete way, we also provide some numerical results which corroborate that under the highly desirable attack, attacked data are not useful in reducing the CRB.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2016.2626258","U.S. Army Research Laboratory; U.S. Army Research Office and was accomplished under Agreement(grant numbers:W911NF-14-1-0245,W911NF-14-1-0261); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738552","Spoofing attack;distributed vector parameter estimation;Cramer-Rao Bound;the expectation-maximization algorithm;sensor network","Quantization (signal);Degradation;Parameter estimation;Cramer-Rao bounds;Government;Electronic mail","estimation theory;matrix algebra;parameter estimation;quantisation (signal);vectors;wireless sensor networks","quantized sensor networks;arbitrary functional forms;optimum spoofing attacks;vector parameter estimation;unknown deterministic vector estimation;quantized sensor data;generalized attack model;attack parameters;guaranteed attack performance;Cramer-Rao bound;attacked sensors;estimation system;Fisher information matrix;dimension attack vector parameter;quantization levels","","24","","34","IEEE","8 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Information is always stored and transmitted in a certain form, and images are good information carrier due to its large amount of data and redundancy. But in real application, images are often transmitted in compressed form. It is a key issue to combine data compression with information carrying, In this paper, we introduce a model for information carrying and design a scheme for the vector quantization method. Finally, the experiment results are given and analyzed, so the feasibility of carrying information is testified.","","0-7803-2916-3","10.1109/ICCT.1996.544970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=544970","","Data security;Image coding;Data compression;Vector quantization;Information analysis;Testing","security of data","information carrying;vector quantized images;independent messages;data security;information carrier","","","","4","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is shown that the IDQD describes a quantization-induced fundamental limitation on the estimation capabilities of the system. To be specific, if the dimension of the desired vector parameter is larger than the IDQD of the quantized estimation system, then the Fisher information matrix for estimating the desired vector parameter is singular, and, moreover, there exist infinitely many nonidentifiable vector parameter points in the vector parameter space. Furthermore, it is shown that under some common assumptions on the statistical models of the observations and the quantization system, a smaller IDQD can be obtained, which can specify an even more limiting quantization induced fundamental limitation on the estimation capabilities of the system.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2018.2850968","Army Research Laboratory(grant numbers:W911NF-17-1-0331); Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems(grant numbers:ECCS-1744129); Division of Computer and Network Systems(grant numbers:CNS-1702555); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8398401","Distributed sensor parameter estimation;inestimable dimension for quantized data;singular Fisher information matrix;identifiability;quantization","Quantization (signal);Estimation;Parameter estimation;Sensors;Electronic mail;Arrays;Limiting","matrix algebra;statistical analysis;vector quantisation","estimation capabilities;maximum parameter dimension;quantized data;quantization approach;quantized estimation system;IDQD;quantization regions;statistical models;vector quantizers;quantization-induced fundamental limitation;desired vector parameter;vector parameter space;quantization system;infinitely many nonidentifiable vector parameter point","","3","","36","IEEE","27 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, in our work the CSIs are estimated at the mobile stations (MSs) and the estimated CSIs (ECSIs) are decomposed by invoking singular value decomposition. The signal space of right-hand side unitary matrix of the decomposed ECSI associated with each of the MSs is then vector quantized and the magnitudes and phases are communicated to the BS as channel spatial information through noisy feedback channels. This vector quantized channel spatial information which is tainted by noise is recovered by employing minimum mean square error based linear detector. The recovered spatial information is then utilized to conceive the pre-processing matrix to deal with the DL multi-user interference (MUI). Our study shows that, MUTP realized with perfect CSI at the BS is capable of completely eliminating the MUI. However, vector quantized channel spatial information based MUTP results in imperfect removal of MUI, as the quantization errors and feedback channel induced errors play a principal role in determining its performance in the context of interference removal. Albeit the achievable symbol error rate (SER) slightly degrades compared to the perfect CSI case, we advocate that vector quantization seems to be an efficient approach in quantizing the necessary spatial information and feeding them back to the BS for the purpose of formulating the pre-processing matrix particularly in frequency division duplex aided wireless systems.","","978-1-4673-4866-9","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577217","Channel spatial information;perfect CSI;minimum mean square error;multi-antenna interference multi-user interference;multiple-input multiple-output;singular value decomposition;vector quantization","Vectors;Noise measurement;Transmitters;MIMO;Noise;Multiaccess communication;Channel estimation","antenna arrays;feedback;interference suppression;MIMO communication;singular value decomposition;vector quantisation","MIMO downlink communication;multiuser transmitter pre-processing;vector quantized channel spatial information;MUTP;multiple-input multiple-output downlink communication;channel state information;CSI;preprocessing matrix;base station;feedback channels;mobile stations;singular value decomposition;right-hand side unitary matrix;noisy feedback channels;minimum mean square error based linear detector;DL multiuser interference;quantization errors;feedback channel;symbol error rate;frequency division duplex aided wireless systems;multi antenna interference","","","","20","","15 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the CIRs are estimated with a known estimation technique, and the estimated CIRs are VQ and the magnitudes and phases are fed back through noisy feedback channels to the BS. At the BS, this noise infected VQ-CIRs are recovered using a linear detector and the recovered CIRs are then exploited to formulate the preprocessing matrix to mitigate the DL multi-user interference (MUI).

Further, the attainable bit error rate (BER) degrades when noise contaminated VQ-CIRs are invoked to realize the preprocessing matrix compared to its perfect CIRs counterpart.

However, in many real-world situations, the source output may be corrupted by some additive noise. In this case, we only have access to a noisy version of the data, but we expect a designed quantizer to minimize the distortion with respect to the clean (unavailable) data. It can be shown that the mean square distortion for an optimal noisy source vector quantization system can be decomposed into an optimum estimator, followed by an optimum source coder operating on the estimator output. We summarize this result first and then propose to use the kernel regression technique for estimating the clean data from the noisy version. The output of the kernel regression, as an estimate of the clean data, is quantized using the LBG vector quantizer. The proposed structure requires two sets of training data. The first set is used to train the kernel regression estimator. The second set is fed into the trained kernel regression system whose output is used to train the LBG vector quantizer.

To suppress the harmonic spikes in three-phase multilevel voltage source converters, a digital control scheme based on dithered sigma-delta modulation (SDM) is proposed in this paper. Introducing a dithered sequence in an SDM varies the switching frequency randomly, resulting in the suppression of the spurious harmonic spikes in the output spectrum even with a regular control input. Although the switching frequency varies randomly, the minimum pulsewidth of the proposed scheme is the sampling time period, avoiding the minimum pulsewidth problem. Instead of a conventional scalar quantizer, the quantizer in the proposed dithered sigma-delta converter uses the principle of space vector quantization. The proposed scheme is experimentally verified on a constant v/f open-loop induction motor drive for a three-level inverter realized by cascading two two-level inverters. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with different pulsewidth modulation schemes in the entire modulation index, including the overmodulation region.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2014.2361491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915895","Digital modulation;harmonic distortion;dithered sigma delta modulator;space vector quantization;Digital modulation;dithered sigma–delta modulator (DSDM);harmonic distortion;space vector quantization","Vectors;Inverters;Sigma-delta modulation;Modulation;Switches;Harmonic analysis;Aerospace electronics","digital control;harmonics suppression;induction motor drives;power convertors;sigma-delta modulation;vector quantisation","space-vector-quantized dithered sigma-delta modulator;harmonic noise reduction;deterministic switching frequency schemes;multilevel converters;enhanced electromagnetic emission;spurious harmonic spikes suppression;digital control scheme;three-phase multilevel voltage source converters;SDM;output spectrum;regular control input;sampling time period;minimum pulsewidth problem;scalar quantizer;constant v/f open-loop induction motor drive;three-level inverter;pulsewidth modulation schemes;modulation index;overmodulation region","","21","","24","IEEE","3 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite its theoretical and empirical success, the method has one major bottleneck, which is the high computational complexity. In this brief, we propose a both practical and theoretical guaranteed algorithm, block-quantized support vector ordinal regression (BQSVOR), where we approximate the kernel matrix K with [(K)\tilde] that is composed of k 2 constant blocks. We provide detailed theoretical justification on the approximation accuracy of BQSVOR. Moreover, we prove theoretically that the OR problem with the block-quantized kernel matrix [(K)\tilde] could be solved by first separating the data samples in the training set into k clusters with kernel k-means and then performing SVOR on the k cluster representatives. Hence, the algorithm leads to an optimization problem that scales only with the number of clusters, instead of the data set size. Finally, experiments on several real-world data sets support the previous analysis and demonstrate that BQSVOR improves the speed of SVOR significantly with guaranteed accuracy.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2009.2017533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808173","Block quantization;clustering;ordinal regression (OR);support vector machine (SVM)","Support vector machines;Kernel;Machine learning;Inference algorithms;Parametric statistics;Computational complexity;Approximation algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Quantization;Information retrieval","computational complexity;matrix algebra;optimisation;pattern clustering;regression analysis;support vector machines","block-quantized support vector ordinal regression;computational complexity;kernel matrix;k-mean clustering;optimization problem","","12","","29","IEEE","31 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the large model size and tremendous computation of CNNs, they cannot be efficiently executed in small devices like mobile phones. Although several hardware accelerator architectures have been developed, most of them can only efficient address one of the two major layers in CNN, convolutional (CONV) and fully connected (FC) layers. In this paper, based on algorithm-architecture-co-exploration, our architecture targets at executing both layers with high efficiency. Vector quantization technique is first selected to compress the parameters, reduce the computation, and unify the behaviors of both CONV and FC layers. To fully exploit the gain of vector quantization, we then propose an accelerator architecture for quantized CNN. Different DRAM access schemes are employed to reduce DRAM access. We also design a high-throughput processing element architecture to accelerate quantized layers.

This paper presents VQCPC-GAN, an adversarial framework for synthesizing variable-length audio by exploiting Vector-Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding (VQCPC). A sequence of VQCPC tokens extracted from real audio data serves as conditional input to a GAN architecture, providing step-wise time-dependent features of the generated content. The input noise $z$ (characteristic in adversarial architectures) remains fixed over time, ensuring temporal consistency of global features. We evaluate the proposed model by comparing a diverse set of metrics against various strong baselines.

The proposed technique can be used within any hybrid video encoder allowing a different coding mode for any macroblock. The key tool of the new mode is the lossy coding of motion vectors, obtained via quantization: while the transformed motion-compensated residual is computed with a high-precision motion vector, the motion vector itself is quantized before being sent to the decoder, in a rate/distortion optimized way. Several problems have to be faced with in order to get an efficient implementation of the coding mode, especially the coding and prediction of the quantized motion vectors, and the selection and encoding of the quantization steps.

Interband coder design is relatively straightforward since the design of the single codebook involved follows readily from a representative set of interband data vectors. Intraband coder design is more complicated since it entails the selection of a vector dimension and a bit-rate for each subband. The main contribution of this work is an optimal methodology for intraband subband vector quantizer design. The problem formulation includes constraints on the bit-rate and the encoding complexity and is solved with nonlinear programming methods. Subband vector quantization image coding in conjunction with a human visual system model is thoroughly investigated. Results of a large number of experiments indicate that the optimal intraband coder yields superior results from quantitative as well as subjective points of view than the interband coder for comparable bit-rates.

Several algorithms have been developed and studied in this context. However, the reduction of number of samples (or the sampling rate) is one aspect of compressive sensing. In fact, the quantization of the observations, which is generally unavoidable in practice (due to the analog-to-digital conversion), could be also understood as another aspect of compressed sensing aiming at reducing the complexity of the sampling device. Moreover, reducing the ADC resolution might be much more beneficial in terms of circuit complexity and power consumption than decreasing the sampling rate. Therefore, we investigate this further aspect of compressive sensing related to the resolution of measurements instead of their number. We first present an efficient message-passing-like iterative algorithm for estimating a vector from quantized linear noisy observations. Contrary to the related work in [1], the algorithm does not require any prior information about the sparse input (such as distribution or norm) and can be applied for arbitrary quantizer resolution. Then, a state evolution analysis is carried out to study the dynamics of the iterative algorithm and can be used to optimize the quantizer characteristic. Finally, some experimental results are provided to demonstrate the validity and performance of the presented algorithm.","","978-1-4577-1924-0","10.1109/WSA.2012.6181205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6181205","","Vectors;Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Quantization;Complexity theory;Compressed sensing","analogue-digital conversion;compressed sensing;iterative methods;signal resolution;vector quantisation;vectors","compressive sensing;sparse vector estimation;analog-to-digital conversion resolution;ADC resolution;circuit complexity;power consumption;message-passing-like iterative algorithm;quantized linear noisy observation;arbitrary quantizer resolution;state evolution analysis","","17","","10","","12 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But increasing the number of reference templates for the same word to recognize, leads to an increase in memory resources and computing time. The proposed algorithm is used in the learning phase and combines the advantages of DTW and Vector Quantization (VQ); instead of storing multiple reference templates, it stores only one reference model for each word and that reference is based on classes (like in the vector quantization method), each class is represented by a centroid (or codeword). In the recognition phase, the parameters of the unknown utterance are compared to the centroids of the reference model. This solution increases the speed of calculation in the recognition phase and reduces the quantity of used memory.","","978-1-4244-6363-3","10.1109/ICCOMM.2010.5509068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509068","Dynamic Time Warping;speech recognition reference template;vector quantization","Speech recognition;Vector quantization;Dynamic programming;Parameter extraction;Cepstral analysis;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Hidden Markov models;Microphones;Digital filters;Neural networks","speech coding;speech recognition;vector quantisation","dynamic time warping;DTW algorithm;vector quantization;speech recognition","","10","","10","","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prosody modeling has several challenges: 1) the extracted pitch used in previous prosody modeling works have inevitable errors, which hurts the prosody modeling; 2) different attributes of prosody (e.g., pitch, duration and energy) are dependent on each other and produce the natural prosody together; and 3) due to high variability of prosody and the limited amount of high-quality data for TTS training, the distribution of prosody cannot be fully shaped. To tackle these issues, we propose ProsoSpeech, which enhances the prosody using quantized latent vectors pre-trained on large-scale unpaired and low-quality text and speech data. Specifically, we first introduce a word-level prosody encoder, which quantizes the low-frequency band of the speech and compresses prosody at-tributes in the latent prosody vector (LPV). Then we introduce an LPV predictor, which predicts LPV given word sequence. We pre-train the LPV predictor on large-scale text and low-quality speech data and fine-tune it on the high-quality TTS dataset. Finally, our model can generate expressive speech conditioned on the predicted LPV. Experimental results show that ProsoSpeech can generate speech with richer prosody compared with baseline methods.","2379-190X","978-1-6654-0540-9","10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9746883","Text-to-speech;prosody modeling;pre-training","Training;Shape;Conferences;Focusing;Speech enhancement;Signal processing;Predictive models","learning (artificial intelligence);speech coding;speech synthesis;vectors","ProsoSpeech;LPV;prosody enhancement;natural prosody modeling;TTS training;text-to-speech;quantized vector pre-training;high-quality TTS dataset;low-quality speech data;large-scale text;latent prosody vector;word-level prosody encoder;low-quality text;quantized latent vectors","","","","24","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A wavelet packet transform (WPT) is used to decompose the audio signal into frequency bands slightly finer than the critical band divisions. A masking model computation is then used as input to the hybrid quantization scheme, where scalar quantization is used for coding the subbands from 0-5.5 kHz, and vector quantization is used for coding the subbands from 5.5-22 kHz. The performance of the proposed coder is assessed from segmental signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and the perceived quality for a number of signals. The perceived quality is determined from informal comparisons between the uncoded signals at the original bitrate of 705 kb/s, and the same signals coded with (1) the proposed coder at 80 kb/s, (2) a coder using only scalar quantization at both 128 kb/s and 96 kb/s, and (3) the MPEG layer III coder at 64 kb/s. The comparisons indicate that a very good coder quality is possible with the proposed coder at bitrates of approximately 80 kb/s. This represents a saving of about 16 kb/s over full scalar quantization with a similar quality. Further bitrate reduction with the proposed coder is possible by entropy coding of the scalar quantized transform coefficients and the VQ indices.","1520-6149","0-7803-3192-3","10.1109/ICASSP.1996.543541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=543541","","Audio coding;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms;Bit rate;Signal processing;Frequency conversion;Vector quantization;Entropy coding;Signal resolution;Systems engineering and theory","audio coding;vector quantisation;audio signals;entropy codes;wavelet transforms;transform coding","wavelet packet transform;audio coding;hybrid scalar-vector quantization;high quality audio signals;frequency bands;masking model;vector quantization;scalar quantization;coder performance;segmental signal-to-noise ratios;SNR;perceived quality;uncoded signals;coded signals;MPEG layer III coder;bitrate reduction;entropy coding;scalar quantized transform coefficients;VQ indices;0 Hz to 5.5 kHz;5.5 to 22 kHz;705 kbit/s;80 kbit/s;128 kbit/s;96 kbit/s;64 kbit/s","","13","","11","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work addresses this general question through the specific use of a quantized and dithered random linear mapping, which combines, in the following order, a subGaussian random projection in RM of vectors in RN, a random translation, or dither, of the projected vectors, and a uniform scalar quantizer of resolution δ > 0 applied componentwise. Thanks to this quantized mapping, we are first able to show that, with high probability, an embedding of a bounded set K ⊂ RN in δZM can be achieved when distances in the quantized and in the original domains are measured with the l1- and l2-norm, respectively, and provided the number of quantized observations M is large before the square of the “Gaussian mean width” of K. In this case, we show that the embedding is actually quasi-isometric and only suffers from both multiplicative and additive distortions whose magnitudes decrease as M-1/5 for general sets, and as M-1/2 for structured set, when M increases. Second, when one is only interested in characterizing the maximal distance separating two elements of K mapped to the same quantized vector, i.e., the “consistency width” of the mapping, we show that for a similar number of measurements and with high probability, this width decays as M-1/4 for general sets and as 1/M for structured ones when M increases. Finally, as an important aspect of this paper, we also establish how the non-Gaussianity of sub-Gaussian random projections inserted in the quantized mapping (e.g., for Bernoulli random matrices) impacts the class of vectors that can be embedded or whose consistency width provably decays when M increases.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2017.2717583","Belgian National Science Foundation (F.R.S.-FNRS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953672","Quantization;restricted isometry property;compressed sensing;dimensionality reduction","Distortion;Additives;Sparse matrices;Quantization (signal);Distortion measurement;Complexity theory;Nearest neighbor searches","compressed sensing;computational complexity;distortion;Gaussian processes;matrix algebra;probability;quantisation (signal);random processes;vectors","quantized random embeddings;low-complexity sets;low-complexity vectors;sparse vectors;low-rank matrices;quantized random linear mapping;dithered random linear mapping;random translation;uniform scalar quantizer;probability;Gaussian mean width;quasiisometric embedding;multiplicative distortions;additive distortions;quantized vector;consistency width;width decays;nonGaussianity;subGaussian random projections","","3","","54","IEEE","20 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been shown that SSQ performs far better than conventional independent scalar quantization, while offering significant computational advantage over conventional VQ techniques. However, the design technique was a greedy method. The present authors use asymptotic quantization theory to derive a globally optimal design procedure for SSQ. With this method, the quantization of a scalar depends not only on its marginal density conditioned on the previously quantized scalars, but also on the distribution of the unquantized scalars.

Typically, a few thousand keypoints are extracted from each image. Image matching involves distance computations across all pairs of SIFT feature vectors from both images, which is quite costly. We show that SIFT features perform surprisingly well even after quantizing each component to binary, when the medians are used as the quantization thresholds. Quantized features preserve both distinctiveness and matching properties. Almost all of the features in our 5.4 million feature test set map to distinct binary patterns after quantization. Furthermore, number of matches between images using both the original and the binary quantized SIFT features are quite similar. We investigate the distribution of SIFT features and observe that the space of 128-D binary vectors has sufficient capacity for the current performance of SIFT features. We use component median values as quantization thresholds and show through vector-to-vector distance comparisons and image-to-image matches that the resulting binary vectors perform comparable to original SIFT vectors. We also discuss computational and storage gains. Binary vector distance computation reduces to bit-wise operations. Square operation is eliminated.

The basic idea behind this method is to quantize and hence compress the input (or feature) space. Different from sparsification, the new approach uses the “redundant” data to update the coefficient of the closest center. In particular, a quantized kernel least mean square (QKLMS) algorithm is developed, which is based on a simple online vector quantization method.

In LCVQ, the vector to be quantized is decomposed into a gain factor and a shape vector which is a normalized version of the input vector. Both components are quantized independently and transmitted to the decoder. Compared to other GSVQ approaches, in LCVQ the input vectors are normalized based on the maximum norm (also denoted as L∞-norm) instead of the typically used Euclidean norm (L2-norm). Therefore, all shape vectors are located on the surface of the unit hypercube. As a conclusion, the shape vector quantizer can be realized based on uniform scalar quantizers yielding low computational complexity as well as high memory efficiency even in case of very high vector dimensions. In this paper, the concept of LCVQ is presented. Also, theoretical quantization performance measures for LCVQ as well as the optimal allocation of bit rate for gain factor and shape vector are derived. In order to assess the proposed LCVQ approach, the quantization performance achieved by LCVQ is compared to results which were recently derived for Logarithmic Spherical Vector Quantization (LSVQ), another highly efficient GSVQ scheme proposed in.","","978-4-88552-267-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400939","","Vectors;Signal to noise ratio;Bit rate;Shape;Vector quantization;Equations","computational complexity;decoding;vector quantisation;vectors","logarithmic cubic vector quantization;LCVQ;gain-shape vector quantization;GSVQ;gain factor decomposition;decoder transmission;maximum norm;L∞-norm;Euclidean norm;L2-norm;hypercube surface;uniform scalar quantization;computational complexity;optimal bit rate allocation","","","1","11","","7 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Discrete latent variable models have been shown to learn nontrivial representations of speech, applicable to unsupervised voice conversion and reaching state-of-the-art performance on unit discovery tasks. For unsupervised representation learning, they became viable alternatives to continuous latent variable models such as the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). However, training deep discrete variable models is challenging, due to the inherent non-differentiability of the discretization operation. In this paper we focus on VQ-VAE, a state-of-the-art discrete bottleneck model shown to perform on par with its continuous counterparts. It quantizes encoder outputs with on-line k-means clustering. We show that the codebook learning can suffer from poor initialization and non-stationarity of clustered encoder outputs. We demonstrate that these can be successfully overcome by increasing the learning rate for the codebook and periodic date-dependent codeword re-initialization. As a result, we achieve more robust training across different tasks, and significantly increase the usage of latent codewords even for large codebooks. This has practical benefit, for instance, in unsupervised representation learning, where large codebooks may lead to disentanglement of latent representations.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207145","VQ-VAE;k-means;discrete information bottle-neck","Training;Task analysis;Nickel;Feature extraction;Quantization (signal);Robustness;Reservoirs","pattern clustering;unsupervised learning;vector quantisation","discrete bottleneck model;latent representations;codebooks;latent codewords;periodic date-dependent codeword re-initialization;learning rate;clustered encoder outputs;codebook learning;discretization operation;nondifferentiability;deep discrete variable models;continuous latent variable models;unsupervised representation learning;unit discovery tasks;unsupervised voice conversion;discrete latent variable models;VQ-VAE;Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder models;discrete representation;Vector Quantized bottleneck models;robust training","","","","37","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The communications channel is modelled as a time-invariant channel contaminated by intersymbol interference (ISI). Since the ISI channel can be viewed as a rate-1 encoder and since the redundancy of the source cannot be perfectly removed by source encoding, a joint channel equalization and source decoding scheme may be employed for enhancing the achievable performance. In our study the channel equalization and the source decoding are operated iteratively on a bit-by-bit basis under the maximum aposteriori (MAP) criterion. The channel equalizer accepts the apriori information provided by the source decoding and also extracts extrinsic information, which in turn acts as a priori information for improving the source decoding performance. Simulation results are presented for characterizing the achievable performance of the iterative channel equalization and source decoding scheme.

One solution is to employ an hybrid implementation, digital at baseband and analog at radio frequencies. In this paper we develop two iterative hybrid beamforming design algorithms for the MMW channel, using vector quantization of the analog beamformers. The proposed algorithms accounts for the RF precoding constraints and assumes the channel matrix is known but not the ray phase vector responses.

"Stochastic vector quantization, and stochastic VQ with state feedback using neural networks","E. Levine","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, CA, USA","Proceedings of Data Compression Conference - DCC '96","6 Aug 2002","1996","","","330","339","Memoryless vector quantization (VQ) is the process of representing a continuous-valued vector by a vector function of a discrete-valued index. A novel system which performs VQ stochastically is introduced. This system uses an encoder which produces, for a given vector to be quantized, a probability distribution over the N indices, then randomly chooses one of the N indices using that distribution. The structure used to compute the distribution is a feedforward neural network classifier. The decoder is a simple codebook lookup exactly as in plain VQ. The performance of this memoryless stochastic scheme must be suboptimal. By taking the error to be minimized as the expected value, over the set of random choices, of the error between original vector and decoder output, it is possible to find the error gradient over the encoder/classifier's outputs and decoder's codebook vectors. Then gradient descent (backpropagation) may be used to train all the system's parameters in order to minimize the error. When the data to be quantized is a correlated sequence of vectors, each vector could be quantized separately by a memoryless VQ system. However, performance can be improved in theory by using some state information about the past. The usual state-feedback extension of plain VQ is finite-state vector quantization (FSVQ). Unfortunately, there is no known optimal training procedure for FSVQ. The stochastic VQ scheme can also be extended to use feedback state information. Unlike for FSVQ, the optimal training scheme (given the structure of the system) is known. By using gradient descent (backpropagation-through-time), the system can be trained to optimize its parameters. Experimental results show that this stochastic system with state-feedback can perform up to 0.45 dB better than FSVQ on a Gauss-Markov source.","1068-0314","0-8186-7358-3","10.1109/DCC.1996.488338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488338","","Stochastic processes;Vector quantization;Decoding;Probability distribution;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Backpropagation;State feedback","state feedback;feedforward neural nets;stochastic processes;memoryless systems;vector quantisation;backpropagation;Markov processes;Gaussian processes;decoding","stochastic vector quantization;state feedback;neural networks;memoryless VQ;encoder;codebook;probability distribution;feedforward neural network classifier;performance;error gradient;gradient descent;backpropagation;correlated sequence;finite-state vector quantization;optimal training procedure;Gauss-Markov source","","","","5","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is assumed that the vector quantizer parameters (dimension, codebook size) are subject to a complexity constraint. The vector quantization lower bound on the attainable distortion at a given (high) rate is used for deriving the bit allocation algorithm for given vector dimensions. Then, the joint optimization of vector dimensions and bit allocations is considered.

We analytically study the impact of the quantization on the system performance, where it is shown that while ideal ESPARs with ideal loads can achieve a similar performance to conventional MIMO, the performance of ESPARs will be degraded when only loads with quantized values are available. We further extend the performance analysis to imperfect channel state information. In order to alleviate the performance loss, we propose to approximate the ideal current vector by optimization, where a closed-form solution is further obtained. This enables the use of ESPARs in practice with quantized loads. Simulation results validate our analysis and show that a significant performance gain can be achieved with the proposed scheme over ESPARs with quantized loads.

In particular, we propose using quantized Haar wavelet features and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for rear-view vehicle detection. Wavelet features are particularly attractive for vehicle detection because they form a compact representation, encode edge information, capture information from multiple scales, and can be computed efficiently. Traditionally, methods using wavelet features for classification truncate the coefficients by keeping only the ones with largest magnitude. We believe that the actual values of the wavelet coefficients are not very important for vehicle detection. In fact, the coefficient magnitudes indicate local oriented intensity differences, information that cold be very different even for the same vehicle under different lighting conditions. Therefore, we argue and demonstrate experimentally that the actual coefficient values are less important compared to the simple presence or absence of those coefficients. Specifically, we propose quantizing large negative coefficients to -1, large positive coefficients to 1, and setting the rest coefficients to 0. The quantized coefficients seem to encode important information about the general shape and structure of vehicles, while ignoring fine details and allowing for sufficient inter-class variability. Experimental results and comparisons using real data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach which has achieved an average accuracy of 93.94% on completely novel test images.","","981-04-8364-3","10.1109/ICARCV.2002.1235021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1235021","","Support vector machines;Vehicle detection;Remotely operated vehicles;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Histograms;Computer vision;Focusing;Shape;Vehicle driving","road vehicles;support vector machines;wavelet transforms;feature extraction;Haar transforms;image classification;edge detection","wavelet transform;Haar transform;support vector machines;feature selection;road vehicle detection;encode edge information;wavelet coefficients;coefficient magnitudes;lighting conditions;negative coefficients;positive coefficients;inter class variability;quantized wavelet features;feature classification;information capture;novel test images","","25","1","14","","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we study the use of VQ-VAE for representation learning of downstream tasks, such as image retrieval. First, we describe the VQ-VAE in the context of an information-theoretic framework. Then, we show that the regularization effect on the learned representation is determined by the size of the embedded codebook before the training. As a result, we introduce a hyperparameter to balance the strength of the vector quantizer and the reconstruction error. By tuning the hyperparameter, the embedded bottleneck quantizer is used as a regularizer that forces the output of the encoder to share a constrained coding space. With that, the learned latent features better preserve the similarity relations of the data space. Finally, we incorporate the product quantizer into the bottleneck stage of VQ-VAE and use it as an end-to-end unsupervised learning model for image retrieval tasks. The product quantizer has the advantage of generating large and structured codebooks. Fast retrieval can be achieved by using lookup tables that store the distance between any pair of sub-codewords.

Using features rather than whole templates makes the algorithm more robust to background clutter and partial occlusions. Instead of representing the features with real-valued eigenvector principle components, we use binary vector quantization to avoid floating point computations. The object is detected in the image using a simple geometric hash table and Hough transform. On a test of 1000 images, the algorithm works on 99.3%.

Several techniques, including modified cycle enumeration, and the efficient derivation of problematic inputs for finer quantizers from those of coarser ones are employed to reduce the complexity of the enumeration. The error rate estimate is derived by testing the input vectors of small distances followed by estimating the contribution of larger distance vectors.

Specifically, in our system the MIMO channel impulse responses (CIRs) are vector quantized. Then, the CIR magnitudes and phases are conveyed to the transmitter via a feedback channel, which is noise contaminated and may also experience Rayleigh fading. At the transmitter, the CIRs used for transmit preprocessing are recovered using a soft estimator, which is optimum in the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) sense, and is implemented based on the so-called Hadamard soft-decoding principles. Our study and simulation results demonstrate that vector quantization combined with soft-decoding constitutes an efficient technique of feeding back the CIRs from the receiver to the transmitter.

Adopting the tool of stochastic geometry, we analyze the coverage probability under the quantized zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF). This analysis, however, intricate as a typical UE in a given cell experiences: i) a residual inter-user interference (IUI) rendered by the quantization error; ii) quantization-driven statistical correlation between its attending signal power and IUI; iii) Nakagami-type fading environment, induced by postprocessing ZFBF; and iv) intercell interference (ICI). Current related literature has not effectively accounted for issues (i), (ii), and (iv) and commonly resorted to simplifying scenarios of full SDMA (i.e., exponential fading), independency of IUI and attending signal power, approximating IUI via an exponential random variable, and the quantization cell approximation (QCA). Our analysis relaxes such limiting assumptions; it includes the more relevant random vector quantization (RVQ) method, and compared to the literature, does not resort to the evaluation of a higher order differentiation for the evaluation of the coverage probability by exploiting our previously developed method. We further introduce three novel approximations of the coverage probability: RVQ-M, RVG-G, and QCA, which the first two approximations are given in semi-closed-form formulas (requiring a simple integration step) and the last approximation is in a closed-form expression. All approximations are numerically affordable, and we confirm the RVG-G approximation is the most accurate one. Finally, we exploit our analysis to study several practically insightful issues to shed some lights on: 1) for given feedback capacity and number of UEs, when desification becomes beneficial; 2) how multitierness of HetNets can be exploited for substantially reducing feedback capacity; and 3) an adaptive share of feedback capacity for the purpose of CDI as well as channel quality information (CQI) feedbacks, when there is an uplink penalty subjected for the feedback procedure and the scheduled data rate at each BS is specified adaptively based on the quantized CQI.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2017.2780519","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671088); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference-F, Toronto; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8168275","Area spectral efficiency (ASE);coverage probability;heterogenous cellular networks (HetNets);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;quantization cell approximation (QCA);quantized multi-user zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF);random vector quantization (RVQ);stochastic geometry","Multiaccess communication;Quantization (signal);MIMO;Array signal processing;Cellular networks;Fading channels;Geometry","antenna arrays;array signal processing;cellular radio;channel capacity;multiuser channels;Nakagami channels;quantisation (signal);radiofrequency interference;space division multiple access;stochastic processes","multitier heterogeneous networks;quantized multiuser ZF beamforming;large-scale heterogenous cellular network;residual inter-user interference;quantization error;attending signal power;quantization cell approximation;relevant random vector quantization method;quantized CQI;coverage probability analysis;single-antenna user equipments;space division multiple access;stochastic geometry;quantization-driven statistical correlation;Nakagami-type fading environment;intercell interference;RVG-G approximation;channel quality information","","6","","59","IEEE","6 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This major challenge highlights the need for data compression techniques. In this study, we apply a physics-informed Deep Learning technique based on vector quantization to generate a discrete, low-dimensional representation of data from simulations of three-dimensional turbulent flows. The deep learning framework is composed of convolutional layers and incorporates physical constraints on the flow, such as preserving incompressibility and global statistical characteristics of the velocity gradients. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical, comparison-based similarity and physics-based metrics. The training data set is produced from Direct Numerical Simulation of an incompressible, statistically stationary, isotropic turbulent flow. The performance of this lossy data compression scheme is evaluated not only with unseen data from the stationary, isotropic turbulent flow, but also with data from decaying isotropic turbulence, and a Taylor-Green vortex flow. Defining the compression ratio (CR) as the ratio of original data size to the compressed one, the results show that our model based on vector quantization can offer CR = 85 with a mean square error (MSE) of $O$(10−3), and predictions that faithfully reproduce the statistics of the flow, except at the very smallest scales where there is some loss. Compared to the recent study based on a conventional autoencoder where compression is performed in a continuous space, our model improves the CR by more than 30 percent, and reduces the MSE by an order of magnitude. Our compression model is an attractive solution for situations where fast, high quality and low-overhead encoding and decoding of large data are required.","2375-0359","978-1-6654-7893-9","10.1109/DCC52660.2022.00039","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ACI-1548562); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9810711","","Deep learning;Solid modeling;Computational modeling;Vector quantization;Computational fluid dynamics;Data compression;Training data","data compression;deep learning (artificial intelligence);flow simulation;image coding;image representation;mean square error methods;mechanical engineering computing;statistical analysis;turbulence;vector quantisation;vortices","low-dimensional data representation;three-dimensional turbulent flow simulation;physical constraints;global statistical characteristics;comparison-based similarity;physics-based metrics;direct numerical simulation;incompressible turbulent flow;statistically stationary turbulent flow;isotropic turbulent flow;lossy data compression scheme;Taylor-Green vortex flow;compression ratio;physics-informed vector quantized autoencoder;physics-informed deep learning technique;convolutional layer;mean square error;MSE","","","","17","IEEE","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The notion behind the projection onto QCS is to prevent the postprocessed data from diverging from QCS, i.e., blurring, which is usually caused by a low-pass filtering operation. First, we theoretically analyze the projection onto QCS, and show that the projection onto a subset of QCS could yield a better performance than the projection onto QCS case. Since the quantizer regions in the vector quantizer (VQ) are arbitrarily shaped unless the VQ has a structural codebook, it is not easy to implement a projector for QCS. In order to simplify the projection, we introduce hypercubes for a subset of QCS, where the hypercubes are the elements of the subset. Hence, the proposed postprocessing algorithm has two steps: linear space-invariant low-pass filtering (or projecting onto smoothness constraint sets) and then projecting onto hypercubes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce blocking artifacts without blurring the edge components, and achieve a 0.5-2.0-dB gain. Furthermore, the contouring effect can also be removed by iteratively applying the proposed postprocessing algorithm, based on the constrained minimization problem.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.931108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=931108","","Hypercubes;Quantization;Noise shaping;Iterative algorithms;Image coding;Low pass filters;Filtering;Encoding;Image reconstruction;Performance analysis","vector quantisation;image coding;minimisation;low-pass filters;filtering theory;iterative methods","vector-quantized image processing;projection onto hypercubes;blocking artifacts reduction;VQ images;postprocessing algorithm;quantization constraint set;projection onto QCS;postprocessed data;blurring;performance;vector quantizer;structural codebook;linear space-invariant low-pass filtering;projecting onto smoothness constraint sets;simulation results;edge components;gain;contouring effect;constrained minimization problem;iterative postprocessing","","4","","27","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Utilizing the proposed quantizer with infinite data rate, the quadratic stabilization problems of linear systems via state feedback under quantization can be converted, respectively, to the same problems of the corresponding robust control systems with sector bound uncertainties. From a practical point of view, we are more concerned with quantized feedback control with finite data rate, so a quantizer with finite data rate is proposed for the abovementioned problems. Different from the quantizer with infinite data rate, a time-varying bounded quantization region needs to be determined to contain the quantized vector as the system evolves. Under this circumstance, the vector needed to be quantized cannot be quantized directly, so we give a quantization method to solve this problem.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2021.3059845","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073046,61572082,61603055); Program of Science and Technology, Department of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:20180550839); Program of Bohai University(grant numbers:0515bs040-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354965","Finite data rate;quantized feedback;quantizer;sector bound uncertainty;spherical polar coordinates","Quantization (signal);Uncertainty;Robust control;State feedback;Linear systems;Symmetric matrices;Feedback control","control system synthesis;discrete time systems;feedback;linear systems;quantisation (signal);robust control;stability;state feedback;time-varying systems;uncertain systems","quantized feedback control;finite data rate;infinite data rate;quantization region;quantized vector;quantization method;spherical polar coordinate quantizer;uniform quantizer;logarithmic quantizer;novel quantizer;linear systems;spherical polar coordinates;corresponding quantization error;corresponding robust control systems","","","","33","IEEE","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the subband synthesis process, the relationships between subband spectra and whole band LPC spectrum are established and thus the vector quantized subband LPC parameters are mapped to the whole band LPC parameters. This new SBS-LPC-VQ method overcomes high complexity problem of vector quantization of LPC parameters and isolates the distortion within each subband during the VQ process. It also provides the flexibility of assigning the bits to be used for each subband, choosing the order for LPC filter and determining the number of bands for the subband classification. The Critical band Weighting Spectral Distortion Measure (CW-SDM), which is a perceptually motivated objective measure by using a critical band weighting function, is used for measuring the distortion of quantized LPC spectrum. Using this kind of distortion measure, the experiments show that the SBS-LPC-VQ has obtained 24 bits/frame for coding whole 16th order LPC parameters with about 1 dB average spectral distortion. For comparison, the results by conventional spectral distortion measure (SDM) are also presented in the paper.","","0-7803-6416-3","10.1109/SCFT.2000.878418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=878418","","Linear predictive coding;Vector quantization;Distortion measurement;Filters;Speech analysis;Weight measurement;Frequency;Network synthesis;Signal analysis;Signal processing","speech coding;vector quantisation;linear predictive coding;spectral analysis","subband synthesized LPC vector quantization;SBS-LPC-VQ;LPC parameter quantization method;subband synthesis process;subband spectra;whole band LPC spectrum;LPC filter;subband classification;critical band weighting spectral distortion measure;perceptually motivated objective measure;average spectral distortion;speech coding","","","","12","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an extension of the transform coding framework, in our approach codevectors are constrained to be located on a series of line segments in the multidimensional space. These segments are designed sequentially based on a training set. The advantages of seg-VQ are twofold: first, the encoding complexity is proportional to the number of segments rather than to the number of codevectors, and second, it can efficiently exploit the directional preferences (correlations) in sources such as images. For image sources, at low dimensions (e.g., 4 by 4 blocks), at the same encoding complexity with TSVQ, seg-VQ outperforms TSVQ by 0.5 dB at 0.4375 bpp achieving a performance close to unconstrained VQ obtained by pairwise nearest neighbor (PNN) initialized GLA. At higher dimensions (e.g., 8 by 8 blocks) we use multistage seg-VQ where the input block (as in transform coding) is projected into a series of segments in order to be quantized.","1522-4880","0-7803-7750-8","10.1109/ICIP.2003.1246673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246673","","Image coding;Vector quantization;Transform coding;Image segmentation;Encoding;Multidimensional systems;Signal processing;Image processing;Nearest neighbor searches;Image reconstruction","image coding;vector quantisation;transform coding","image coding;multistage vector quantization;transform coding;image block projection;basis function series;constrained vector quantizer;multistage seg-VQ;codevector;multidimensional space;encoding complexity;tree structure VQ;pairwise nearest neighbor;GLA;expansion coefficient quantization;line segment series","","1","","3","","24 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Constantinescu and Storer (1994) introduced an adaptive vector quantization algorithm (AVQ) that combines adaptive dictionary techniques with vector quantization (VQ). The algorithm typically equals or exceeds the compression of the JPEG standard on different classes of images and it often outperforms traditional trained VQ. We show how it is possible to improve AVQ on the class of images on which JPEG does best (i.e., ""magazine photographs""). The improvement is possible by exploring the similarities in the dictionary built by AVQ. This is achieved by transforming the input vectors in a way similar to the one used in mean-shape-gain VQ (Oehler and Gray, 1993). In MSGVQ each vector x~/spl isin/R/sup n/ is decomposed as x~=g/spl middot/s~+E/sub x//spl middot/1~, where g=/spl par/x~-E/sub x//spl middot/1~/spl par/ and s~=(x~-E/sub x//spl middot/1~)/g; mean, gain and shape <E/sub x/,g,s~> are quantized separately. We apply this idea to AVQ, changing the match heuristic: let <E/sub b/,g/sub b/,S~/sub b/> and <E/sub p/,g/sub p/,S~/sub p/> be respectively the <mean, gain, shape> of the dictionary block b and of the one anchored in p. The entry b is the best match if d(x~/sub p/,x/spl circ/)/spl les/T (x/spl circ/=g/sub p//spl middot/s~/sub b/+E/sub p//spl middot/1~) and its size is maximum. The triple <b,E/sub p/,g/sub b/> is entropy coded and sent to the decoder. This simple modification of the match heuristic allows AVQ to improve the compression ratio on many images. In some cases this improvement is as high as 60%. Along with the better compression results, there is also an improvement in the overall visual quality of the decoded image, especially at high compression rate.","1068-0314","0-7695-0096-X","10.1109/DCC.1999.785703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=785703","","Vector quantization;Tiles;Decoding;Tin;Speech processing;Acoustic signal processing","vector quantisation;entropy codes;maximum entropy methods;image matching;image coding;adaptive codes;adaptive decoding","single-pass adaptive vector quantization;adaptive dictionary techniques;image compression;magazine photographs;mean-shape-gain VQ;match heuristic;maximisation;entropy coding;decoder;compression ratio;visual quality","","","","2","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Initially, a median filter is applied to remove the inherent noise in the colored image. SIFT features of the image are then extracted and computed forming a vector, which is then quantized into visual words. Finally, the histogram of the frequency of each element in the visual vocabulary is created and fed into an SVM classifier, which categorizes the mushrooms as either healthy or unhealthy. Our preliminary results for mushroom classification are promising and the experiments carried out on the data set highlight faster computation time and a higher rate of accuracy, reaching over 90% using this method, which can be employed in real life scenario.","","978-0-7695-4983-5","10.1109/CRV.2013.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6569214","Mushroom harvesting robot;mushroom identification;mushroom classification;support vector machine;visual vocabulary;SIFT features","Kernel;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Visualization;Accuracy;Histograms;Robots","agriculture;crops;feature extraction;image classification;median filters;object recognition;robot vision;support vector machines;transforms;vector quantisation","support vector machine;mushroom microbial spoilage detection;mushroom categorization;SVM classifier;visual vocabulary;frequency histogram;visual words;vector quantization;image SIFT feature extraction;colored image;inherent noise removal;median filter;robot efficiency;recognition accuracy;nondestructive method;crop yield maximization;mushroom handling;unhealthy mushroom;mushroom classification;mechanical damage;microbial damage;mushroom damage detection;mushroom harvesting robot;robot vision system","","5","","19","","29 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method can be applied to several biometrics methods using feature vectors, and allows us to significantly reduce the memory size of feature vectors without degrading the recognition performance. In this paper, we prove that minimizing quantization error between the compressed and original vectors is most effective to control the performance in face recognition. A conventional method uses non-uniform quantizer which minimizes the quantization error in terms of L2-distance. However, face recognition methods often use metrics other than L2-distance. Our method can calculate the quantized vectors in arbitrary metrics such as Lp-distance (0 <; p ≤ ∞) and the quantized subspace basis. Furthermore, we also propose a fast algorithm calculating Lp-distances between two quantized vectors without decoding them. We evaluate the performance of our method on FERET, LFW and large face datasets with LBP (Lp-distance), Mutual Subspace Method and deep feature. The results show that the recognition rate using the quantized feature vectors is as accurate as that of the method using the original vectors even though the memory size of the vectors is reduced to 1/5 - 1/10.

The source-sensitivity matched Systems 1-6 characterized in a table were contrived to comparatively study the range of system design options. For example, using Codec 1 in System 1 and coherent pilot symbol assisted 16-level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-PSAQAM), an overall signaling rate of 9 kBd was yielded, if the noise-limited channel had a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in excess of about 22 dB in the vicinity of the basestation or in indoors scenarios. In contrast, over lower quality outdoors channels near the fringes of the cell, the more robust 4-QAM mode of operation had to be invoked, which required twice as many time slots to accommodate the resulting 18-kBd stream and hence, reduced the total number of users supported. The robustness of Systems 2-4, and 6 was increased using automatic repeat requests (ARQ), again, inevitably reducing the number of users supported, which was between 6 and 16. In a bandwidth of 200 kHz, similarly to the Pan-European GSM mobile radio system's speech channel, using Systems 1, 3, 4, or 5, for example, 16 and eight videophone users can be supported in the 16- and 4-QAM modes, respectively, while in dual-mode cells the number of users is between eight and 16. The basic system characteristics are highlighted.","1939-9359","","10.1109/25.580772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=580772","","Videophone systems;Codecs;Noise robustness;Signal to noise ratio;Quadrature phase shift keying;Automatic repeat request;Transceivers;Interference;Video compression;Bit rate","vector quantisation;land mobile radio;indoor radio;transceivers;video codecs;videotelephony;cordless telephone systems;BCH codes;quadrature amplitude modulation;automatic repeat request;cellular radio;noise","low-rate cordless videophone systems;indoor applications;outdoor applications;dual-mode wireless videophone transceivers;vector quantization;video quality;bit rate;robustness;complexity;perceptually weighted vector quantized codecs;run length compression;quarter common intermediate format;videophone sequences;BCH codes;system design;coherent pilot symbol assisted 16QAM;signaling rate;noise-limited channel;signal-to-noise ratio;basestation;4-QAM;automatic repeat requests;GSM;11.36 kbit/s;20.32 kbit/s;8 kbit/s;200 kHz","","24","1","60","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most research in this area has focused on classification algorithms using raw image pixels, and very few have been proposed to utilize the quantized visual features, such as the popular bag-of-words feature abstraction. In such cases, besides the inherent quantization errors, ambiguity associated with visual word assignment and misdetection of feature points, due to factors such as visual occlusions and noises, constitutes the major cause of dense corruptions of the quantized representation. The dense corruptions can jeopardize the decision process by distorting the patterns of the sparse reconstruction coefficients. In this paper, we aim to eliminate the corruptions and achieve robust image analysis with SR. Toward this goal, we introduce two transfer processes (ambiguity transfer and mis-detection transfer) to account for the two major sources of corruption as discussed. By reasonably assuming the rarity of the two kinds of distortion processes, we augment the original SR-based reconstruction objective with \mmbl0-norm regularization on the transfer terms to encourage sparsity and, hence, discourage dense distortion/transfer. Computationally, we relax the nonconvex \mmbl0-norm optimization into a convex \mmbl1-norm optimization problem, and employ the accelerated proximal gradient method to optimize the convergence provable updating procedure. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, Corel-5k, and CMU pose, illumination, and expression, manifest the necessity of removing the quantization corruptions and the various advantages of the proposed framework.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2219543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310054","Image classification;quantized visual feature;sparse representation","Histograms;Vectors;Visualization;Optimization;Quantization;Feature extraction;Noise","image classification;image recognition;image representation;quantisation (signal)","robust image analysis;sparse representation;quantized visual features;high-level visual recognition;sparse corruptions;classification algorithms;quantized visual features;bag-of-words feature abstraction;quantization errors;feature points misdetection;visual occlusions;quantized representation;sparse reconstruction coefficients;decision process;misdetection transfer;ambiguity transfer;SR-based reconstruction objective;Caltech-101;Caltech-256;Corel-5k;CMU pose;illumination;quantization corruptions;lo-norn regularisation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","41","","42","","21 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The quantized vector is then relayed to the transmitter via a rate-limited feedback channel. The RVQ codebook requires an exhaustive search to locate the selected entry. To reduce the search complexity, we apply generalized Lloyd or k-dimensional (kd)-tree algorithms to organize RVQ entries into a tree. In examples shown, the search complexity of tree-structured (TS) RVQ can be a few orders of magnitude less than that of the unstructured RVQ for the same performance.

The paper considered an implementation of the BCJR algorithm where the state metrics are vector quantized, and the operations are performed using table lookups. Table lookup operations are efficiently implemented in both hardware and software. The proposed algorithm uses off-line computation to generate vector quantizers and lookup tables, and the only run-time operations are table lookups.

As a first step toward this goal, we compare and contrast uniqueness measures proposed for different biometric modalities. Then, we introduce a new uniqueness measure that evaluates the entropy of i-vectors while taking into account speaker level variations. Our measure operates in the discrete feature space and relies on accurate estimation of the distribution of i-vectors. Therefore, i-vectors are quantized while ensuring that both the quantized and original representations yield similar speaker verification performance. Uniqueness estimates are obtained from two newly generated datasets and the public VoxCeleb dataset. The first custom dataset contains more than one and a half million speech samples of 20,741 speakers obtained from TEDx Talks videos. The second one includes over twenty one thousand speech samples from 1,595 actors that are extracted from movie dialogues. Using this data, we analyzed how several factors, such as the number of speakers, number of samples per speaker, sample durations, and diversity of utterances affect uniqueness estimates. Most notably, we determine that the discretization of i-vectors does not cause a reduction in speaker recognition performance. Our results show that the degree of distinctiveness offered by i-vector-based representation may reach 43-70 bits considering 5-second long speech samples; however, under less constrained variations in speech, uniqueness estimates are found to reduce by around 30 bits. We also find that doubling the sample duration increases the distinctiveness of the i-vector representation by around 20 bits.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3071574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9404191","Biometrics;speaker recognition;i-vector;uniqueness estimation;distinctiveness of a modality","Biometrics (access control);Biological system modeling;Authentication;Entropy;Speaker recognition;Iris recognition;Human voice","biometrics (access control);quantisation (signal);signal representation;speaker recognition;speech recognition;vectors","uniqueness estimates;TEDx Talks videos;speaker verification performance;speaker level variations;i-vectors entropy;uniqueness measures;speech utterances feature representation;speaker recognition performance;public VoxCeleb dataset;quantized representations;discrete feature space;biometric modalities;i-vector model;human voice;i-vector-based representation;word length 43.0 bit to 70.0 bit","","","","45","IEEE","14 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This method is based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) whose latent space is modeled by a conditional variant of the recently developed Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). We find that this latent-space method is well-suited for text-to-image generation tasks because it not only eliminates the unidirectional bias with existing methods but also allows us to incorporate a mask-and-replace diffusion strategy to avoid the accumulation of errors, which is a serious problem with existing methods. Our experiments show that the VQ-Diffusion produces significantly better text-to-image generation results when compared with conventional autoregressive (AR) models with similar numbers of parameters. Compared with previous GAN-based text-to-image methods, our VQ-Diffusion can handle more complex scenes and improve the synthesized image quality by a large margin. Finally, we show that the image generation computation in our method can be made highly efficient by reparameterization. With traditional AR methods, the text-to-image generation time increases linearly with the output image resolution and hence is quite time consuming even for normal size images. The VQ-Diffusion allows us to achieve a better trade-off between quality and speed. Our experiments indicate that the VQ-Diffusion model with the reparameterization is fifteen times faster than traditional AR methods while achieving a better image quality.

An important special case of GVQ is the problem of noisy source coding wherein a quantized approximation of a vector, Y, is obtained from observation of its noise-corrupted version, X. The optimal GVQ encoder has high complexity. We overcome the complexity barrier by optimizing a structurally-constrained encoder.

With an optimum decomposition, we can adaptively allocate bits by varying the block size to be quantized. Predictive vector quantization (PVQ) allows us to take advantage of the correlation between adjacent blocks of pixels being encoded by providing memory. The quadtree structure is used to represent the segmentation information and is sent as side information. To reduce the encoding complexity, we use hierarchical table lookups so no arithmetic computations have to be performed to find the minimum distortion codeword.

The goal of the masking function is to set the error such that reconstruction of audible samples is exact whereas the reconstruction of inaudible samples is such that the absolute magnitude of the error is minimized. We compute the entropy of the quantized pointers to all blocks, the quantized pointers to the applied transforms, the quantized scalars used to create the linear combination of transformed blocks, and the error vector returned.","2375-0359","0-7695-2309-9","10.1109/DCC.2005.70","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402222","","Entropy;Psychology;Encoding;Psychoacoustic models;Vectors;Mathematics;Cities and towns;Educational institutions;Costs;Bars","entropy codes;audio coding;parameter estimation;signal representation;signal sampling;acoustic filters;vector quantisation","parameter analysis;generalized LZ compression;audio compression;compression rates;representation error masking;psycho-acoustic filter;audible sample reconstruction;inaudible sample reconstruction;error magnitude minimization;entropy;quantized pointers;transforms;quantized scalars;error vector","","1","","2","","11 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We aim to jointly optimize the precoding vector and the precoding factor to minimize the mean-squared error between the transmitted and the estimated symbols. However, the considered precoding problem is nonconvex and challenging to solve because the precoding vector and the precoding factor are coupled together. To address this problem, we apply the alternating minimization (AltMin) framework to decouple the considered problem into two problems: the precoding factor design problem and the precoding vector design problem. The former has an analytical solution, while the latter requires solving a difficult combinatorial problem, which we address by proposing a simple yet efficient gradient projection (GP)-based algorithm to find an approximate precoding vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GP-based AltMin algorithm achieves the same or higher BER performance than state-of-the-art algorithms while requiring lower complexity. In addition, when higher order modulations are employed, the error floor experienced by the existing algorithms can be substantially mitigated by the proposed GP-AltMin algorithm through increasing the number of phase bits.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2898902","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2221-E-017-001-MY2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8640023","Alternating minimization;constant envelope;gradient projection;massive MIMO;quantized precoding","Precoding;Approximation algorithms;Downlink;Phase shift keying;Radio frequency;Minimization;Complexity theory","concave programming;gradient methods;mean square error methods;MIMO communication;minimisation;phase shift keying;precoding;quantisation (signal);radiofrequency power amplifiers;telecommunication signalling;vectors","GP-based;GP-AltMin algorithm;phase bits;efficient constant envelope precoding;quantized phases;massive MU-MIMO downlink systems;massive multiuser multiple-input multipleoutput systems;output signals;digital-to-analog converters;power-efficient power amplifiers;base station;alternating minimization framework;precoding factor design problem;precoding vector design problem;approximate precoding vector;mean-squared error minimization;precoding problem;gradient projection-based algorithm;generalized constant envelope-based precoding design problem;M-ary phase-shift keying signaling;low-cost power amplifiers;combinatorial problem","","4","","13","IEEE","12 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our work, we assume that each of the K destination mobile stations (DMS) is supported by a group of mobile stations (MSs) acting as relays to achieve the relay diversity. Specifically, we employ preprocessing at the base station (BS) to suppress the multi-user interference (MUI) at the relays that precludes in achieving the relay diversity. Further, inter-relay interference (IRI) at the destination mobile stations (DMSs) is mitigated with the support of the preprocessing operated at the relays. To be specific, the preprocessing operated at the BS is based on the maximum-signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR) approach, while that operated at the relays is based on the classical minimum-mean-square error principle. Both the preprocessing approaches are formulated based on the VQ-CSI acquired via feedback channels. Our study demonstrates that TP-aided cooperative DL MC-CDMA system results in better achievable bit-error-rate (BER) as the TP assists in achieving the relay diversity by eliminating the DL-MUI and IRI at the relays and the DMSs, respectively. Furthermore, our study reveals that the attainable BER of the VQ-CSI based TP remains close to that attained with the perfect CSI based TP.","","978-1-4799-3358-7","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950138","MC-CDMA;transmitter preprocessing;relay diversity;multi-user interference","Relays;Downlink;Transmitting antennas;Integrated circuits;Signal to noise ratio;Interference","code division multiple access;cooperative communication;diversity reception;error statistics;mean square error methods;multiuser channels;relay networks (telecommunication)","cooperative communication aided MC CDMA system;transmitter preprocessing;vector quantized CSI;multicarrier code division multiple access system;vector quantized channel state information;feedback channels;mobile stations;multiuser interference;relay diversity;minimum mean square error principle;bit error rate","","","","14","","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, work in this direction has mostly concentrated on using an alternate scanning technique based on space filling curves. Recently the authors defined the notion of a scan model that can be viewed as defining a connected scan of an image and gave algorithms to compute optimal scans for a variety of cost functions. Since an optimal scan varies from image to image, an encoding of the scan has to accompany an encoding of an image with respect to the scan. In most applications this turns out to be prohibitively expensive. By predictive scanning, the authors mean scanning an image along a prediction of the optimal scan. For multispectral images, an optimal scan of one band serves well as the prediction of the optimal scan for a spectrally adjacent band due to the presence of spectral correlations. In this paper the authors show how predictive scanning techniques can be used along with vector quantization to give an efficient compression technique for multispectral image data. The technique captures spectral as well as spatial correlations and hence performs significantly better than techniques that use spectrally adjacent blocks to form a vector that is subsequently quantized.<>","","0-7803-1497-2","10.1109/IGARSS.1994.399118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=399118","","Vector quantization;Multispectral imaging;Image coding;Filling;Hilbert space;Computer science;Video compression;Protection;Bandwidth;Wavelet transforms","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing;infrared imaging;image coding;vector quantisation;image colour analysis;data compression","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;remote sensing;optical imaging;scan predictive vector quantization;image coding;data compression;multispectral imaging;image compression scheme;scan model;optimal scan;encoding;predictive scanning;multispectral image","","","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike typical multimedia instruction set extensions (e.g., MDMX, MMX, ALTIVEC), QCPX obtains substantial performance and code density improvements through implicit support for color pixel processing rather than depending solely on generic subword parallelism. To fully measure its impact, QCPX is evaluated in the context of a massively data-parallel SIMD execution platform where data parallelism is harnessed by an orthogonal mechanism. Simulation results indicate that the 32-bit QCPX ISA achieves an overall average speedup of 584% over the non-QCPX and 88% over the 32-bit MDMX-like ISA with four media applications in a same machine platform.

In the mantissa-quantization stage, EOFP-QNN learns how to quantize the mantissa bits of the model parameters while preserving the regression accuracy in the least mantissa precision. In the exponent-quantization stage, the exponent part of the parameters is further quantized without any additional performance degradation.

The first technique is called the affine transformations VQ, in which the quantized vector is formed by adding the transformed outputs of a multistage codebook rather than just adding the outputs of the stages as in regular multistage vector quantization (MSVQ). The name of the VQ technique comes from the fact that in the two-stage case, the quantized vector is obtained as the result of an affine transformation. This technique can be viewed as a generalized form of MSVQ. If the transformations are constrained to be the identity transformation, this technique becomes identical to the regular MSVQ. The transformations in the introduced technique are selected from a family of linear transformations, represented by a codebook of matrices. In order to I reduce the memory required for storing the matrices, the paper discusses a second technique called scaled rotation matrices VQ, where matrices are constrained to be scaled rotation matrices. Since rotation matrices can be stored by just storing the corresponding rotation angles, this approach enables efficient storage of linear transforms. The design algorithms are based on joint optimization of the linear transformation and the stage codebooks.

We formulate minimum mean-square-error-aided TP matrix using noisy feedback of vector-quantized estimated channel information (CI) for frequency-division duplexing system. Clearly, we estimate the CI and perform vector quantization (VQ) at each MS and transmit the index of the quantized value through dedicated low rate noisy channel. Finally, we acquire CI of all active users using known estimation algorithm in order to build TP. We realize time-frequency domain signature sequence to support more user population. In particular, we analyze the ER performance of coded MC-CDMA system with TP for Stanford University Interim channel model. The ER curve shows that coded MC-CDMA system based on TP approach provides better performance with less signal-to-noise ratio while offering low complexity of MS.

The adaptive signal decomposition uses wavelet packets that allow to best match the decomposition to the signal nonstationary characteristics. In order to obtain a good tradeoff between frequency and spatial localization, nonstationary wavelet packets based on filters varying at each stage of the tree structured decomposition are considered. The complete tree is pruned into the best basis subtree which minimizes a perceptually weighted distortion for a given bit rate. Each subband is then quantized using data rate constrained lattice vector quantizers. The choice of the quantizer is usually determined by the minimization of the overall mean squared error of the reconstructed signal under the constraint of a given bit rate [Ramchandran and Vetterli, 1993]. However, this procedure is not optimum in terms of visual quality. A procedure of quantization based on the minimization of perceptually weighted distortion of each frequency band is introduced. The results show a very significant improvement both in terms of SNR and of visual quality versus the JPEG algorithm.<>","","0-8186-6952-7","10.1109/ICIP.1994.413833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=413833","","Wavelet packets;Lattices;Vector quantization;Frequency;Bit rate;Filter bank;Signal resolution;Tree data structures;Entropy;Image reconstruction","vector quantisation;wavelet transforms;image coding;transform coding;minimisation;adaptive signal processing;trees (mathematics);image reconstruction","lattice vector quantization;data rate allocation;wavelet packet coding;coding scheme;joint optimization;signal decomposition;adaptive signal decomposition;signal nonstationary characteristics;frequency localization;spatial localization;nonstationary wavelet packets;filters;tree structured decomposition;subtree;perceptually weighted distortion;mean squared error;reconstructed signal;visual quality","","5","","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interpolative vector quantizer maps quantized low dimensional 2/spl times/2 image blocks into higher dimensional 4/spl times/4 blocks by a table lookup method. Furthermore, we show that by mapping overlapping 2/spl times/2 input blocks into the four center pixels of the 4/spl times/4 output image block the quality of the interpolated images improves noticeably.

However, its effectiveness depends greatly on the matching of the VQ elements with the image data values. Prior to the VQ process, orthogonal transforms such as a DCT or FFT are often used to convert an image in the spatial domain to transform coefficients in the frequency domain. In this paper, instead of orthogonal transform coefficients, bi-orthogonal wavelet filters are used to transform a satellite image to the scale-frequency domain. The wavelet coefficients are vector quantized and their statistical features are analyzed in details such as computational complexity and performance efficiency. Some examples will be shown in the presentation to illustrate the advantage of using bi-orthogonal wavelets that can help to improve the matching of VQ elements to the image data values. Through matching the image values, it can be shown that fewer VQ elements would be required to represent the image while maintaining the image quality, Improving the VQ statistical features will in turn increase the compression ratios of image compression of satellite images.","","0-7803-5207-6","10.1109/IGARSS.1999.774568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=774568","","Vector quantization;Satellites;Image coding;Wavelet transforms;Digital images;Discrete cosine transforms;Image converters;Frequency domain analysis;Wavelet domain;Filters","geophysical techniques;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing;data compression;image coding;image processing;wavelet transforms;vector quantisation","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;remote sensing;image processing;image compression;vector quantization;satellite image;bi-orthogonal wavelets;wavelet transform;image coding;matching;bi-orthogonal wavelet filter;scale-frequency domain","","1","","5","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lastly, fast VQ algorithms of the LSP parameters are compared in terms of complexity, using the Euclidean distance measure. The well-known ordering property of LSP parameters is exploited to improve the efficiency of minimum distortion encoder for VQ in terms of norm associated to its distance. As conventional full search is too complex for practical implementation, the originality of this work consists in using the norm to limit the size of the area which contains the nearest neighbor of an input vector to he quantized.

After the process of normalization completed, the pitch-contour of each training syllable is vector quantized(VQ). The lexical tones of adjacent syllables and the quantization code are combined both to define the observation symbol sequences for HMM training. Using a dynamic-programming based algorithm in the synthesis phase, for given a sentence and related text-analysis information, the probable observation sequence is generated by finding the sentence wide largest probability path.

Firstly, the augmented state method is adopted to provide a more effective frame to solve the quantized filtering. Namely, the quantized error vector can be taken as a state component by the augmented technology. Accordingly, a novel quantized state estimator is proposed by using Kalman filter (KF). Secondly, because Strong Tracking Filtering (STF) has better estimation accuracy and the ability of processing state abrupt change than Kalman filter for the case with uncertain state model, another novel quantized state estimator is proposed by combing the STF with augmented state model.

Performance evaluations and comparisons with linear predictive speech coding are presented.

The layerwise QNNs deploy only required number of data bits for the computation (e.g., convolution of weights and activations), which in turn reduces computation energy compared to the conventional QNNs. However, the layerwise QNNs still cause a large amount of energy in the conventional memory systems, since memory accesses are not optimized for the required precision of each layer. To address this problem, we propose Quant-PIM, an energy-efficient processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerator for layerwise QNNs. Quant-PIM selectively reads only required data bits within a data word depending on the precision, by deploying the modified I/O gating logics in a 3-D stacked memory. Thus, Quant-PIM significantly reduces energy consumption for memory accesses. In addition, Quant-PIM improves the performance of layerwise QNNs. When the required precision is half of the weight (or activation) size or less, Quant-PIM reads two data blocks in a single read operation by exploiting the saved memory bandwidth from the selective memory access, thus providing higher compute-throughput. Our simulation results show that Quant-PIM reduces system energy by 39.1%~50.4% compared to the PIM system with 16-bit quantized precision, without accuracy loss.","1943-0671","","10.1109/LES.2021.3050253","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2020R1A2C2003500); Samsung Electronics; College of Information, Korea University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317832","Accelerator;energy efficiency;layerwise quantization;processing-in-memory (PIM);quantized neural network (QNN)","Memory management;Decoding;Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Through-silicon vias;Energy efficiency;Quantization (signal)","cache storage;embedded systems;energy consumption;memory architecture;neural nets;power aware computing;quantisation (signal);storage management;vector quantisation;wireless sensor networks","Quant-PIM;energy-efficient processing-in-memory accelerator;layerwise quantized neural networks;layerwise manner;layerwise QNNs deploy;computation energy;conventional QNNs;conventional memory systems;memory accesses;required precision;required data bits;selective memory access;system energy;PIM system;16-bit quantized precision","","1","","15","IEEE","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A histogram is generated by counting the number of vectors in each quantized region, which is obtained by VQ processing of an image. This histogram is used as an effective RR feature for IQA. To show the effectiveness of the proposed IQA metric, we compare the results with differential mean opinion score data for laboratory for image and video engineering (LIVE) data images. Experiments with LIVE data images for various types of test images show that the proposed metric gives better performance than the conventional methods such as the structural similarity, mean squared error, and singular value decomposition.","2159-1423","978-1-4244-2975-2","10.1109/ISCE.2009.5156895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5156895","image quality assessment;vector quantization;MOS;logistic regression","Image quality;Vector quantization;Histograms;Feature extraction;Data mining;Quality assessment;Laboratories;Singular value decomposition;Humans;PSNR","image processing;mean square error methods;singular value decomposition","image quality assessment;vector quantization histogram;differential mean opinion score data;LIVE data images;mean squared error;singular value decomposition","","","","10","","6 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The non-predictive scheme omits prediction step in the temporal axis. Hence, it increases robustness for transmission at low bit rate in mobile channel. The video sequence is grouped into a number of frames (GOP) and the same subband from each frame in the GOP are joined together to exploit their spatial-temporal redundancies. The significant vectors of the joined subband within the GOP are quantized using a novel multistage lattice vector quantization (MLVQ). This process reduces quantization errors and enhances the reconstruction quality of the frames.

Conventional multimode QP (MM-QP), however, does not consider the adaptive rate allocation among substreams; thus, it cannot have the additional gain by adaptive modulation. Furthermore, it is computationally complex since exhaustive matrix inversions are required to determine the optimal mode. In this paper, we propose an efficient MM-QP system that improves the performance of a conventional system in terms of error rate and has a lower computational complexity than the conventional system. First, we define the rate-partitioning vector as the mode and control the rate among substreams and the number of substreams according to the channel instantaneous condition. Second, to reduce the computational complexity for the receiver to determine the optimal mode, the simplified mode-selection technique using estimates of the modal metric is proposed. In the proposed mode-selection technique, the optimal mode can be obtained by several multiplication and division operations. Finally, the mode-reduction technique eliminating the less-frequently used modes is proposed, which leads to a significant reduction of the feedback information with negligible performance loss. In numerical experiments, it was verified that the proposed MM-QP system gives a better error-rate performance than the conventional system, with much less computational complexity for the same amount of feedback information.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2008.925303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4518958","Closed-loop multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems;limited feedback channel;modal metric;mode reduction;multimode;quantized precoding (QP);Closed loop MIMO systems;limited feedback channel;multi-mode quantized precoding;modal metric;mode reduction","MIMO;Feedback;Quadratic programming;Transmitters;Computational complexity;Diversity methods;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Error analysis;Performance loss","matrix inversion;MIMO communication;precoding;telecommunication congestion control","multimode quantized precoding technique;MIMO wireless systems;precoding matrix;matrix inversions;computational complexity;rate-partitioning vector;simplified mode-selection technique;mode-reduction technique","","7","","21","IEEE","14 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes a novel learning framework for n-bit QNNs, whose weights are constrained to the power of two. To solve the gradient vanishing problem, we propose a reconstructed gradient function for QNNs in the back-propagation algorithm that can directly get the real gradient rather than estimating an approximate gradient of the expected loss. We also propose a novel QNN structure named n-BQ-NN, which uses shift operation to replace the multiply operation and is more suitable for the inference on FPGAs. Furthermore, we also design a shift vector processing element (SVPE) array to replace all 16-bit multiplications with SHIFT operations in convolution operation on FPGAs. We also carry out comparable experiments to evaluate our framework. The experimental results show that the quantized models of ResNet, DenseNet, and AlexNet through our learning framework can achieve almost the same accuracies with the original fullprecision models. Moreover, when using our learning framework to train our n-BQ-NN from scratch, it can achieve state-of-the-art results compared with typical low-precision QNNs. Experiments on Xilinx ZCU102 platform show that our n-BQ-NN with our SVPE can execute 2.9 times faster than that with the vector processing element (VPE) in inference. As the SHIFT operation in our SVPE array will not consume digital signal processing (DSP) resources on FPGAs, the experiments have shown that the use of SVPE array also reduces average energy consumption to 68.7% of the VPE array with 16 bit.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2980041","Development Program of Guangdong Province of China(grant numbers:2019B010120001); Key Research and Development Project of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2019C01004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9056829","Deep compression;deep learning;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);quantized neural network (QNN)","Field programmable gate arrays;Quantization (signal);Convolution;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Hardware;Bandwidth","digital signal processing chips;field programmable gate arrays;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","shift operation;SVPE array;FPGA;quantized neural networks;quantized neural network;network compression;field-programmable gate arrays;learning framework;gradient vanishing problem;gradient function;approximate gradient;QNN structure;shift vector processing element array;convolution operation;low-precision QNN;ResNet;DenseNet;AlexNet;Xilinx ZCU102 platform;digital signal processing;energy consumption;word length 16.0 bit","","4","","53","IEEE","3 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During compression some critical information is lost and the perceptual information is left only, which has significant energy for retrieval in the compressed domain. In this paper, the statistical color features are extracted from the quantized histograms in the DCT domain using only the DC and the first three AC coefficients of the DCT blocks of image having more significant information.

This approach is applicable to scenarios such as those enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) which holds much commercial potential and could facilitate distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication in future systems. The receive nodes quantize their received signals and forward the quantized received signals to a receive fusion center. With global channel knowledge and forwarded quantized information from the receive nodes, the fusion center attempts to decode the transmitted symbols. We assume the transmit vector consists of arbitrary constellation points, and each receive node quantizes its received signal with one bit for each of the real and imaginary parts of the signal to minimize the transmission overhead between the receive nodes and the fusion center. Fusing this data is a nontrivial problem because the receive nodes cannot decode the transmitted symbols before quantization. We develop an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) receiver and a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-type receiver at the fusion center. Despite its suboptimality, the ZF-type receiver is simple to implement and shows comparable performance with the ML receiver in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime but experiences an error rate floor at high SNR.

Equivalent relations in terms of both MMSE and SER between quantized and perfect channel feedback cases are established, based on which we investigate the relation between feedback load and SER performance.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5426155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5426155","","MIMO;Broadcasting;Feedback;Quantization;Mean square error methods;Transmitting antennas;Error analysis;Rate-distortion;Interference;Channel state information","broadcast channels;mean square error methods;MIMO communication;precoding","vector perturbation precoding technique;MIMO broadcast channel;quantized channel feedback;multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channels;base station;channel state information;symbol error rate;minimum mean square error criterion;perturbation vector;precoding matrix optimal design","","9","","18","","4 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alternative input selection strategies, such as lookup-table-based direct torque control, rely on heuristically chosen hysteresis bands to determine switching instants, which often results in a suboptimal choice between switching frequency and other performance measures. In this paper, we use an energy-related Lyapunov function to guide the input selection process by making switching decisions based on the stabilizing effect each input has on the closed-loop system. We provide a theoretical analysis of a motor-inverter system, leading to a stability proof for a quantized input control law.

We also study the achievable average sum rate of the proposed quantized CSI-based TH precoding scheme. The expressions of the upper bounds on both the average sum rate of the systems with quantized CSI and the mean loss in average sum rate due to CSI quantization are derived. We also present some numerical results. The results show that the nonlinear TH precoding can achieve much better performance than that of linear zero-forcing precoding for both perfect CSI and quantized CSI cases. In addition, our derived upper bound on the mean rate loss for TH precoding converges to the true rate loss faster than that of zero-forcing precoding obtained in [2] as the number of feedback bits becomes large.

At the receiver, the DFT of the target vector is reconstructed by multiplying the quantized modified residual signal by the DFT of the impulse response of the synthesis filter. The inverse DFT is then calculated, and the resulting time-domain quantized target vector is filtered by the inverse synthesis filter in order to get the excitation to the LPC synthesis filter.

With vector quantization (VQ), these sources are optimally quantized using separate codebooks, which may collectively require an enormous memory space. Since storage is limited in most applications, a convenient way to gracefully trade between performance and storage is needed. Earlier work addressed this problem by clustering the multiple sources into a small number of source groups, where each group shares a codebook. We propose a new solution based on a size-limited universal codebook that can be viewed as the union of overlapping source codebooks. This framework allows each source codebook to consist of any desired subset of the universal code vectors and provides greater design flexibility which improves the storage-constrained performance. A key feature of this approach is that no two sources need be encoded at the same rate. An additional advantage of the proposed method is its close relation to universal, adaptive, finite-state and classified quantization. Necessary conditions for optimality of the universal codebook and the extracted source codebooks are derived. An iterative design algorithm is introduced to obtain a solution satisfying these conditions. Possible applications of the proposed technique are enumerated, and its effectiveness is illustrated for coding of images using finite-state vector quantization, multistage vector quantization, and tree-structured vector quantization.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.679412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=679412","","Vector quantization;Image coding;Bit rate;Image storage;Random access memory;Algorithm design and analysis;Iterative algorithms;Source coding;Rate-distortion;Computer applications","source coding;image coding;vector quantisation;adaptive codes;tree data structures","constrained-storage vector quantization;universal codebook;image compression techniques;memory space;multiple sources;size-limited universal codebook;overlapping source codebooks;universal code vectors;design flexibility;storage-constrained performance;optimality;extracted source codebooks;iterative design algorithm;finite-state vector quantization;multistage vector quantization;tree-structured vector quantization","","19","7","21","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Under the consecutive square entropy learning framework, the basic idea of entropy-guided learning technique is to measure the uncertainty of the input vectors used for QKLMS, and delete those data with larger uncertainty, which are insignificant or easy to cause learning errors. Then, the dataset is compressed. Consequently, by using square entropy, the learning performance of proposed EQ-KLMS is improved with high precision and low computational cost.

The proposed synaptic architecture is fully compatible with the conventional NAND flash memory architecture by adopting a differential sensing scheme and a binary neuron activation of (1, 0). A binary neuron enables using a 1-bit sense amplifier, which significantly reduces the burden of peripheral circuits and power consumption and enables bitwise communication between the layers of neural networks. Operating NAND cells in the saturation region eliminates the effect of metal wire resistance and serial resistance of the NAND cells. With a read-verify-write (RVW) scheme, low-variance conductance distribution is demonstrated for 8 levels.

This paper summarizes the development of generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithms for minimum mean-squared error estimation of a random vector from quantized linear measurements, notably allowing the linear expansion to be overcomplete or undercomplete and the scalar quantization to be regular or non-regular. GAMP is a recently-developed class of algorithms that uses Gaussian approximations in belief propagation and allows arbitrary separable input and output channels. Scalar quantization of measurements is incorporated into the output channel formalism, leading to the first tractable and effective method for high-dimensional estimation problems involving non-regular scalar quantization. Non-regular quantization is empirically demonstrated to greatly improve rate-distortion performance in some problems with oversampling or with undersampling combined with a sparsity-inducing prior. Under the assumption of a Gaussian measurement matrix with i.i.d. entries, the asymptotic error performance of GAMP can be accurately predicted and tracked through the state evolution formalism.","","978-1-4577-2105-2","10.1109/CAMSAP.2011.6136027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6136027","","Quantization;Estimation;Slabs;Belief propagation;Message passing;Distortion measurement;Approximation algorithms","approximation theory;Gaussian processes;least mean squares methods;message passing;signal processing;vector quantisation","generalized approximate message passing estimation;quantized samples;vector estimation;quantized linear measurements;minimum mean squared error estimation;GAMP;Gaussian approximations;belief propagation","","1","","17","","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Visual inference over a transmission channel is increasingly becoming an important problem in a variety of applications.

In this paper, we examine feature compression for support vector machine (SVM)-based inference using quantized randomized embeddings. We demonstrate that embedding the features is equivalent to using the SVM kernel trick with a mapping to a lower dimensional space. Furthermore, we show that universal embeddings - a recently proposed quantized embedding design - approximate a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, commonly used for kernel-based inference.

Here, we propose a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) neural F0 model that is both more efficient and more interpretable than the DAR. This model has two stages: one uses the VQ-VAE framework to learn a latent code for the F0 contour of each linguistic unit, and other learns to map from linguistic features to latent codes. In contrast to the DAR and RNN, which process the input linguistic features frame-by-frame, the new model converts one linguistic feature vector into one latent code for each linguistic unit. The new model achieves better objective scores than the DAR, has a smaller memory footprint and is computationally faster.

The conditions are applicable to all quantized feedback scenarios regardless of the channel distribution, number of transmit antennas, number of quantization vectors or transmit power. The optimality conditions are closely related to the iteration conditions of the Lloyd algorithm, revealing an interesting link between the optimality of beamforming and the optimality of the vector quantizers. Using the conditions, we prove the capacity optimality of beamforming for several quantized feedback scenarios such as the antenna-selection scheme. We also point out examples of quantized feedback scenarios where beamforming is not optimal. We find that for the independent identically distributed Rayleigh fading channel with more than a single bit of quantized feedback, there is no capacity benefit from increasing the number of antennas beyond the number of quantization vectors.

First, a three-level DWT is performed on the original image resulting in ten separate subbands (ten codebooks are generated using the Self Organizing Feature Map algorithm, which are then used in Vector Quantization, of the wavelet transformed subband images, i.e. one codebook for one subband). These subbands are then vector quantized. VQ indices are Huffman coded to increase the compression ratio. A novel iterative error correction scheme is proposed to continuously check the image quality after sending the Huffman coded bit stream of the error codebook indices through the channel so as to improve the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed image. Ten error codebooks (each for each subband of the wavelet transformed image) are also generated for the error correction scheme using the difference between the original and the reconstructed images in the wavelet domain. The proposed method shows better image quality in terms of PSNR at the same compression ratio as compared to other DWT and VQ based image compression techniques found in the literature. The proposed method of image compression is useful for various applications in which high quality (i.e. high precision) are critical (like criminal investigation, medical imaging, etc).","2161-4407","978-1-4244-1820-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2008.4633785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4633785","Vector Quantization;Wavelet Transform;Compression Ratio","Image coding;Wavelet transforms;Image reconstruction;Discrete wavelet transforms;PSNR;Transforms;Vector quantization","data compression;discrete wavelet transforms;error correction codes;Huffman codes;image coding;image reconstruction;iterative methods;vector quantisation","modified vector quantization;image compression technique;discrete wavelet transform;vector quantization index;Huffman code bit stream;iterative error correction scheme;image quality;error codebook index;image reconstruction","","4","","9","","26 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quantized CSI is obtained via Channel Vector Quantization (CVQ) of the so-called composite channel vector, i.e., the product of the channel matrix and an estimation of the receive filter, which cannot be computed exactly at the stage of quantization because of its dependency on the finally chosen precoder. Here, the state-of-the-art approach estimates the receive filter and quantize the composite channel vector such that its Euclidean distance to the estimated composite channel vector is minimized. In this paper, we propose an alternative CVQ method which determines the estimated receive filter vector and the quantized composite channel vector such that the resulting Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR), or an approximation thereof, is maximized. Since the SINR is related to the individual user rates, and therefore related to the sum rate of the system, the presented solution aims at maximizing the system sum rate.

The address-codebook consists of two regions: the active (addressable) region and the inactive (nonaddressable) region. During the encoding process the code vectors in the address-codebook are reordered adaptively in order to bring the most probable address code vectors into the active region. During the encoding of an address combination the active region of the address-codebook is checked. If such an address combination exists its index is transmitted to the receiver; otherwise the address of each block is transmitted individually.

The number of harmonic magnitudes to be quantized depends on the fundamental frequency value and hence is variable, changing from frame to frame. The variable number of components to be quantized makes it difficult to use fixed-dimension vector quantization for harmonic magnitude encoding. In this paper, we introduce a quantization technique called non-square transform vector quantization (NSTVQ) which uses a fixed-dimension vector quantizer combined with a variable-size non-square transform which maps the variable-dimension harmonic magnitude vector into a fixed-dimension vector. The optimal reconstruction procedure for non-square transforms is derived and shown to be equivalent to an optimal least-square estimation procedure. The proposed technique is evaluated experimentally as part of a new coding system called spectral excitation coding (SEC).

The latter may be problematic in certain limited feedback scenarios where only quantized versions of the scaling factor can be made available at the receiver. To circumvent this shortcoming, we propose a modified VP technique where the search of perturbing vectors is limited to the area in the symbol constellation which is constrictive to the information symbols, i.e., the area where the distances from the decision thresholds are increased with respect to a distance threshold. By doing this, the perturbation quantities can only enhance detection and need not be removed at the receiver. Successful detection can therefore be done without the use of the modulo operation and the scaling factor, which makes the proposed VP scheme applicable to limited feedback scenarios. Analytical and simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is free of the error floor typically encountered with conventional VP in the presence of limited feedback.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2013.2291223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6730729","Limited feedback;multi-user MIMO;non-linear precoding;vector precoding","Vectors;Receivers;Complexity theory;Transmitters;Signal to noise ratio;Downlink;Lattices","MIMO communication;perturbation techniques;precoding;vectors","vector perturbation;symbol scaling;low-complexity vector precoding scheme;MU-MISO systems;multiuser multiple input single output systems downlink;limited feedback scenarios;modified VP technique;symbol constellation;decision thresholds;distance threshold;perturbation quantities","","69","","33","IEEE","31 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is noted that the dependence of the vector codebooks on the set of training signals is much less for the MCFD signals than the original video frames. The MCFD signals are classified into the five groups according to the local variances. A multicodebook vector quantizer is designed that is based on all groups.

The traditional view on how to enable CSIT has been as follows: In time-division duplexed (TDD) systems, uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) channel reciprocity allows the use of a training sequence in the UL direction, which is exploited to obtain an UL channel estimate. This estimate is in turn recycled in the next downlink transmission. In frequency-division duplexed (FDD) systems, which lack the UL and DL reciprocity, the CSIT is provided via the use of a dedicated feedback link of limited capacity between the receivers and the transmitter. In this paper, we focus on TDD systems and put their classical approach in question. We show that the traditional TDD setup above fails to fully exploit the channel reciprocity in its true sense. In fact, we show that the system can benefit from a combined CSIT acquisition strategy mixing the use of limited feedback and that of a training sequence. This combining gives rise to a very interesting joint estimation and detection problem for which we propose two iterative algorithms. An outage rate based framework is also developed which gives the resource split between training and feedback. We demonstrate the potential of this hybrid combining in terms of the improved CSIT quality under a global training and feedback resource constraint.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2011.2178841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6099642","Broadcast channels;channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition;MIMO systems;quantized feedback;random vector quantization;reciprocal channels;training","Training;Channel estimation;Transmitters;Vectors;Array signal processing;Receivers;Covariance matrix","antenna arrays;feedback;frequency division multiplexing;receiving antennas;time division multiplexing;transmitting antennas","quantized feedback;multiantenna reciprocal channels;multiple-antenna transmitter;multiple receivers;channel state information at the transmitter;time-division duplexed systems;frequency-division duplexed systems;TDD;CSIT acquisition;FDD","","11","","44","IEEE","9 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If channel gain information (CGI) and channel direction information (CDI) are independently quantized with a product codebook, as in conventional channel quantization, we show that the effect of CDI quantization errors is boosted by the CGI value, which becomes more pronounced as the number of users increases because the selected users are likely to have larger CGI than the others. Motivated by the analysis, we devise a new two-stage quantizer where CGI is quantized at the first stage, and then CDI is adaptively quantized at the second stage according to the quantized CGI value and total number of users. We optimize the two-stage quantizer for an arbitrarily given CGI quantizer and the number of total users.

With a limited feedback rate, channel direction information (CDI) needs to be quantized and fed back from mobile users to a base station. Thus, the accuracy of the quantized channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) will depend on the feedback rate. To increase spectral efficiency, 2 active users in some clusters share the same beamforming vector and thus, will interfere fully with each other. Given a total-feedback rate, we analyze the feedback allocation for clusters with single active user and 2 active users. The objective is to either minimize the maximum outage probability or maximize the minimum rate among all active users in a cell.

For the case where the codebook constraint is relaxed, we design an optimal beamformer that requires feedback from both receivers as well as a scheme that transmits towards the quantized null-space of the eavesdropper's channel.

Although it provides a noninvasive imaging approach to access the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the biggest drawback of this technology is its incapability of localizing the capsule when an abnormality is found by the video source. Existing localization methods based on radio frequency (RF) and magnetic field suffer a great error due to the non-homogeneity of the human body and uncertain movement of the endoscopic capsule. In this paper, we developed a novel image classification technique to analyze the motion of the capsule. The proposed method segments the endoscopic images into sub-regions and classified them using Kernel Support Vector Machine (K-SVM). Our method performs better than the traditional pixel based classification methods since the quantized feature vector is able to better represent the image due to its natural resistant characteristic against the noises. Besides, the Kernel function is able to map the low dimensional feature vectors to higher dimensional space to form a non-linear decision hyper-plane.

Conventional methods of switching like space vector modulation (SVM) rely on high frequency state space averaging that yields unnecessary switching.

This paper proposes a new theory that resolves this conflict between exploiting these practical advantages and retaining an acceptable computational accuracy of the FFT.

All or some of the four subblocks are selected to be directly coded by vector quantization according to the local activity of the large block. The subblocks that are not directly assigned to be vector quantized will be calculated from the coded data. Since a strong correlation exists among the subblocks of the blocks with low local content activity, the approximation will not result in large error.

We design the quantizer of the channel state information to minimize the probability that at least one receiver incorrectly decodes its desired symbol(s). Correspondingly, we introduce a generalized diversity measure that encapsulates the conventional one as the first-order diversity. Additionally, it incorporates the second-order diversity, which is concerned with the transmitter power dependent logarithmic terms that appear in the error rate expression. We first show that for AF relays, the maximal achievable diversity in the presence of interference is strictly less than the transmit diversity bound in terms of the second-order diversity. We then prove that it is possible to achieve the transmit diversity bound using DF relays as if there is no interference and as if coding over an arbitrary number of channel uses is allowed. Relay selection provides the best possible diversity gain for both relaying strategies.

We introduce an overlapped hierarchical vector quantization (OHVQ) scheme that is used as the approximation stage. The output is produced by mapping the OHVQ codes to filtered data.

The method extracts scale invariant features from a query image, computes a small number of quantized random projections of these features, and sends them to a database server. The server performs a nearest neighbor search in the space of the random projections and returns meta-data corresponding to the query image. Prior work has shown that binary embeddings of image features enable efficient image retrieval. This paper generalizes the prior art by characterizing the tradeoff between the number of random projections and the number of bits used to represent each projection. The theoretical results suggest a bit allocation scheme under a total bit rate constraint: It is often advisable to spend bits on a small number of finely quantized random measurements rather than on a large number of coarsely quantized random measurements. This theoretical result is corroborated via experimental study of the above tradeoff using the ZuBuD database. The proposed scheme achieves a retrieval accuracy up to 94% while requiring the mobile device to transmit only 2.5 kB to the database server, a significant improvement over 1-bit quantization schemes reported in prior art.","","978-1-4673-4572-9","10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6343406","","Quantization;Databases;Servers;Vectors;Mobile handsets;Feature extraction;Augmented reality","augmented reality;feature extraction;image retrieval;meta data;quantisation (signal)","quantized embeddings;scale-invariant image features;mobile augmented reality;randomized embeddings;object-specific meta data retrieval;augmented reality application;scale invariant feature extraction;query image;quantized random projections;database server;nearest neighbor search;binary embeddings;image retrieval;coarsely quantized random measurements;ZuBuD database","","10","","24","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The source is assumed to have a probability density function of a GMM. An input vector is first classified to one of the mixture components, and the Karhunen-Loeve transform of the selected mixture component is applied to the vector, followed by quantization using a lattice structured codebook. Finally, the scalar elements of the quantized vector are entropy coded sequentially using a specially designed arithmetic coder. The computational complexity of the proposed scheme is low, and independent of the coding rate in both the encoder and the decoder. Therefore, the proposed scheme serves as a lower complexity alternative to the GMM based ECVQ proposed by Gardner, Subramaniam and Rao. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed under a high-rate assumption, and quantified for a given GMM. The practical performance of the scheme was evaluated through simulations on both synthetic and speech line spectral frequency (LSF) vectors. For LSF quantization, the proposed scheme has a comparable performance to at rates relevant for speech coding (20-28 bits per vector) with lower computational complexity.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2008.070357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4711173","Entropy constrained;vector quantization;VQ;lattice;Gaussian mixture model;GMM;arithmetic coding","Vector quantization;Lattices;Arithmetic;Computational complexity;Probability density function;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Entropy;Decoding;Performance analysis;Computational modeling","arithmetic codes;computational complexity;decoding;entropy codes;probability;transforms;vector quantisation","entropy-constrained vector quantization;Gaussian mixture model;lattice quantization;arithmetic coding;probability density function;Karhunen-Loeve transform;lattice structured codebook;computational complexity;decoder","","22","2","29","","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to obtain a high quality audio, a dynamic bit-allocation algorithm is used to select the best quantizer for each subband based on the outputs of a psychoacoustic model and the total quantization bits available.

In the first layer, a standard VQ is performed on each block of the image. In the second layer, the resulting VQ addresses of the neighboring blocks are merged together to form a new vector which is said to be address vector quantized if this address combination vector can be found in an address codebook. This process of merging four nodes (neighboring addresses) is repeated recursively in a bottom-up hierarchical manner in the subsequent higher layers using the corresponding address codebook in each layer.

This limitation can be overcome by phase rotation of symbols where each symbol is rotated by a rotation matrix. In the new constellation, each symbol attains unique real and imaginary components which imply higher diversity order, and thus, it may result in higher noise margin. Though performance gain can be achieved through the selection of optimum rotation matrix, the high decimal precision of the rotated symbols demands larger memory support and processing effort due to their representation by unquantized real numbers. Quantization of the rotated symbols is a solution for this problem, but it may degrade the bit-error performance. This paper investigates the tradeoff between the bit-error performance of 64-QAM and the compromise in the precision of rotation.","","978-1-4673-0816-8","10.1109/NCC.2012.6176910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176910","signal-space diversity;phase rotation quantization","Fading;Quantization;Constellation diagram;Information theory;Vectors;Quadrature amplitude modulation","error statistics;fading channels;quadrature amplitude modulation;quantisation (signal)","quantized modulation diversity;64-QAM;fading channel;signal constellation;symbol detection;phase rotation;noise margin;optimum rotation matrix;high decimal precision;rotated symbol;memory support;unquantized real number;bit-error performance","","","","4","","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these techniques require a precise knowledge of the channel information at the transmitter. In most of the current systems, transmitter can not estimate the channel so feedback information has to be provided by the receiver. In this paper, we propose a new limited feedback approach where Vector Quantization (VQ) is applied over the channel frequency response. Different configurations of feedback bits per subcarrier in a multiuser MIMO-OFDM system have been simulated. Additionally, different precoding schemes based on the estimated channel information have been tested and BER performance has been evaluated. Results show that, for a similar cost of feedback information (bits/subcarrier), better channel estimates are achieved using longer vectors in the VQ codebook, whereas optimal non-linear precoding schemes perform well even for large channel estimation errors.","2154-0225","978-1-4244-6317-6","10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5624376","","Channel estimation;Training;Estimation;Transmitters;Vector quantization;MIMO;Complexity theory","channel estimation;MIMO communication;modulation coding;multiuser channels;OFDM modulation;precoding;receivers;transmitters;vector quantisation","multiuser MIMO-OFDM precoding;quantized channel information;data throughput;spatial multiplexing;feedback information;vector quantization;VQ codebook;channel frequency response;channel estimation errors","","","","16","","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, the design of a feedback link based on maximum received signal-to-noise ratio criterion is considered. In practice, the transmitter channel state information is degraded by several factors in the feedback link, e.g. bandwidth limitation, delay, and noise which is the main problem. The defective information at the transmitter leads to drastic performance degradation unless the system is robustly designed against the feedback errors and mismatches. Therefore, we employ quantized feedback strategies optimized for noisy channels.

Based on this paradigm, we propose a framework for the MIMO singular value decomposition (SVD) based optimal power allocation, specifically for the context of MIMO video transmission. Further, we consider a practical MIMO scenario with channel state information (CSI) available only at the receiver and employ a codebook based limited feedback technique to feedback the index of the quantized beamforming vector. This significantly reduces the communication overhead on the reverse link of the wireless system. We demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical video decomposition based optimal diversity power allocation employing limited CSI feedback can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that the solution to this problem can be computed by solving an iterative sequence of convex cost minimization problems.

This process of merging four nodes (neighboring addresses) is repeated recursively in a bottom-up hierarchical manner in the subsequent higher layers using the corresponding address codebook in each layer. A three-layer coding system was simulated where the codebook in the first layer is a standard VQ codebook and the codebooks in the other two layers are address codebooks with code vectors consisting of the addresses of the previous layer codebook. Simulation results demonstrate good quality reproduction at bit rates above 0.23 b/pixel for monochrome images and 0.35 b/pixel for RGB color images.<>","","","10.1109/ICC.1990.117203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=117203","","Color;Merging;Vector quantization;Bit rate;Image coding;Computational complexity;Transform coding;Encoding;Pixel","encoding;picture processing","monochrome images;neighbouring addresses merging;multi-layer address-vector quantization;encoding;color images;address codebook","","","1","9","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EMG is a versatile biosignal used in many fields of medical research and its compression is necessary for long-term recordings and narrow-band wireless transmission. The quality of lossy compression-decompression process of a biosignal has to be evaluated with the fidelity of essential medical parameters in mind. In this study, the analysis is focused on the preservation of primarily used spectral variables, namely mean frequency and median frequency. Modified versions of the basic vector quantization, classified vector quantization with two codebooks, classified vector quantization with three codebooks, classified vector quantization with four codebooks, gain-shape vector quantization with unquantized gain value, gain-shape vector quantization with eight gain values, and gain-shape vector quantization with four gain values have been implemented and tested with the segment length of 8 samples and the codebook sizes of 32 codevectors and 64 codevectors. The gain values, used both for criteria of codebook selection in classified vector quantization, and as product code in gain-shape vector quantization, was calculated as a sum of absolute segment values. The gain-shape method with eight quantized gain values shows best results in terms of the compression ratio. The general results reveal systematic bias up to 17.34 Hz in the mean frequency value, but a linear model for correcting the error is presented","","0-7695-2504-0","10.1109/CIMCA.2005.1631411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631411","","Vector quantization;Electromyography;Frequency;Medical diagnostic imaging;Ergonomics;Propagation losses;Distortion measurement;Computer science;Narrowband;Testing","electromyography;error correction;medical signal processing;vector quantisation","EMG signal;biosignal;lossy compression;spectral variable;mean frequency;median frequency;codebook selection;classified vector quantization;gain-shape vector quantization;linear model;error correction;medical fidelity","","3","","21","","22 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EGT is a beamforming technique that maximizes the MISO channel capacity when there is an equal power-per-antenna constraint at the transmitter, and requires the feedback of t-1 phase angles, when there are t antennas at the transmitter. In this paper, we contrast two popular approaches for quantizing the phase angles: vector quantization (VQ) and scalar quantization (SQ). On the VQ side, using the capacity loss with respect to EGT with perfect channel information at transmitter as performance metric, we develop a criterion for designing the beamforming codebook for quantized EGT (Q-EGT). We also propose an iterative algorithm based on the well-known generalized Lloyd algorithm, for computing the beamforming vector codebook. On the analytical side, we study the performance of Q-EGT and derive closed-form expressions for the performance in terms of capacity loss and outage probability in the case of i.i.d.

In both cases, the distortion is uniquely determined by the vector quantization error, i.e., the Euclidean difference between the original vector and the codeword into which it is quantized. We generalize these asymptotic bounds to input-weighted quadratic distortion measures and measures that are approximately output-weighted-quadratic when the distortion is small, a class of distortion measures often claimed to be perceptually meaningful. An approximation of the asymptotic distortion based on Gersho's conjecture is derived as well.

The coding method is based on the known scheme proposed by Chen and Smith (1977) which sorts the picture blocks into classes according to the level of image activity. The coding scheme is modified to allow for vector quantization of the ac coefficients, in particular a pyramid vector quantizer (PVQ) is used. This is based on the statistical and geometric properties of a Laplacian source which, in fact, is the best model for the ac coefficients of the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (2D-DCT) of an image. A method for forming almost statistically independent vectors is also suggested and improves quantization performance. Images are encoded with both the PVQ and standard scalar quantizer transform coders, demonstrating that the PVQ coder reduces the mean square encoding error and improves image quality. In particular, emphasis is given to how the use of fractional bit rates affects the objective and subjective gains obtained.

In addition, a detailed theoretical analysis leads to a lower bound for the quantization distortion related to SVQ. By introducing approximations for the assumption of high bit rates, this bound is the basis for the computation of the optimal allocation of bit rate to the gain and the shape quantizer, respectively, and yields an estimate for the achievable SNR for LSVQ.","","978-1-4244-2068-1","10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4895481","","Vector quantization;Shape;Bit rate;Computational complexity;Dynamic range;Information theory;Communication systems;Data processing;Signal to noise ratio;Independent component analysis","vector quantisation","logarithmic spherical vector quantization;gain-shape vector quantization;high bit rates;logarithmic scalar quantization;spherical vector quantization;LSVQ","","3","4","14","","28 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both components are quantized independently and transmitted to the decoder. Compared to other GSVQ approaches, in LCVQ the input vectors are normalized such that all shape vectors are located on the surface of the unit hypercube. As a conclusion, the shape vector quantizer can be realized based on uniform scalar quantizers. This yields low computational complexity as well as high memory efficiency even in case of very high vector dimensions.

The vector quantization (VQ) process necessarily degrades the image, the degradation being generally a direct function of VQ compression ratio. However, the individual quality measures are affected differently. The computation compression technique (CCT) described is faster because only addition is required, as contrasted with both multiplication and addition for the FFT. The fact that preprocessed segments are overlapped and summed lends itself to parallel processing. Parameters for using CCT are the size of each vector, whether 1-D or 2-D, the number of entries in the codebook, and the address bits.

In this study, we propose the two-stage framework, which consists of Residual-Quantized VAE (RQ-VAE) and RQ-Transformer, to effectively generate high-resolution images. Given a fixed codebook size, RQ-VAE can precisely approximate a feature map of an image and represent the image as a stacked map of discrete codes. Then, RQ-Transformer learns to predict the quantized feature vector at the next position by predicting the next stack of codes. Thanks to the precise approximation of RQ-VAE, we can represent a $256\times 256$ image as $8\times 8$ resolution of the feature map, and RQ-Transformer can efficiently reduce the computational costs. Consequently, our framework out-performs the existing AR models on various benchmarks of unconditional and conditional image generation.

The AC coefficients within blocks are combined into vectors from which a codebook is generated. In quantization, for each vector, the closest codeword is determined. If it is the first time the codeword is selected, the closest codeword is transmitted. Otherwise, the corresponding label is transmitted. To gain efficiency in transmitting the codewords, variable length coding (VLC) is used in encoding the codewords in the DCT domain.

One approach to achieve this goal is to relax PA linearity and to digitally compensate for some of the resulting non-linear effects such as an increased error vector magnitude (EVM) and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR). The required compensation method can be implemented in a non-linear precoding module that exploits the large spatial degrees of freedom in a massive MIMO system. In this paper, we propose using outphasing RF chains with low-resolution phase shifters to generate constrained amplitude and phase-modulated signals with very low hardware complexity. To improve transmit power efficiency and to control the ACLR and EVM, we develop a novel non-linear precoding algorithm that incorporates the quantized phase-shift constraints in the outphasing RF chains. The achieved flexibility to trade-off EVM and ACLR in favor of a higher PA efficiency (and vice versa) is demonstrated by means of simulations.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-8964-2","10.1109/VTC2021-Spring51267.2021.9448980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448980","massive MIMO;outphasing;non-linear precoding;adjacent channel leakage;quantized precoding","Radio frequency;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Precoding;Transmitting antennas;Phase shifters;Massive MIMO;Computer architecture","antenna arrays;MIMO communication;nonlinear codes;precoding;radio transmitters;radiofrequency amplifiers","adjacent channel leakage ratio;ACLR;required compensation method;nonlinear precoding module;massive MIMO system;low-resolution phase shifters;phase-modulated signals;low hardware complexity;transmit power efficiency;EVM;novel nonlinear precoding algorithm;quantized phase-shift constraints;quantized outphasing RF chains;antenna arrays;massive multiple-input multiple-output base stations;transmit radio frequency chains;high power amplifier efficiency;PA linearity;resulting nonlinear effects","","","","17","","15 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data Compression Conference","7 Aug 2002","2002","","","382","391","An algorithm for supervised classification using vector quantization and entropy coding is presented. The classification rule is formed from a set of training data {(X/sub i/, Y/sub i/)}/sub i=1//sup n/, which are independent samples from a joint distribution P/sub XY/. Based on the principle of minimum description length (MDL), a statistical model that approximates the distribution P/sub XY/ ought to enable efficient coding of X and Y. On the other hand, we expect a system that encodes (X, Y) efficiently to provide ample information on the distribution P/sub XY/. This information can then be used to classify X, i.e., to predict the corresponding Y based on X. To encode both X and Y, a two-stage vector quantizer is applied to X and a Huffman code is formed for Y conditioned on each quantized value of X. The optimization of the encoder is equivalent to the design of a vector quantizer with an objective function reflecting the joint penalty of quantization error and misclassification rate. This vector quantizer provides an estimation of the conditional distribution of Y given X, which in turn yields an approximation to the Bayes classification rule. This algorithm, namely discriminant vector quantization (DVQ), is compared with learning vector quantization (LVQ) and CART/sup R/ on a number of data sets.

Recently, sub-Nyquist sampling schemes based on compressed sensing have been proposed to greatly reduce the sampling rate. However, the important issue of quantization has not been fully addressed, particularly, for high resolution spectrum and parameter estimation. In this paper, we aim to recover spectrally sparse signals and the corresponding parameters, such as frequency and amplitudes, from heavy quantizations of their noisy complex-valued random linear measurements, e.g., only the quadrant information. We first characterize the Cramer-Rao bound under Gaussian noise, which highlights the trade-off between sample complexity and bit depth under different signal-to-noise ratios for a fixed budget of bits. Next, we propose a new algorithm based on atomic norm soft thresholding for signal recovery, which is equivalent to proximal mapping of properly designed surrogate signals with respect to the atomic norm that motivates spectral sparsity. The proposed algorithm can be applied to both the single measurement vector case, as well as the multiple measurement vector case. It is shown that under the Gaussian measurement model, the spectral signals can be reconstructed accurately with high probability, as soon as the number of quantized measurements exceeds the order of K log n, where K is the level of spectral sparsity and n is the signal dimension. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate the proposed approaches.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2018.2827326","NSF(grant numbers:ECCS-1462191,CCF-1527456,ECCS-1818571); ONR(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2387); AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-15-1-0205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8340173","Line spectrum estimation;quantization;Cramér–Rao bound;atomic norms;compressed sensing;multiple measurement vectors","Pollution measurement;Quantization (signal);Frequency measurement;Atomic measurements;Signal to noise ratio;Noise measurement;Signal processing algorithms","compressed sensing;Gaussian noise;numerical analysis;parameter estimation;quantisation (signal);signal reconstruction;signal sampling;spectral analysis","sampling rate;high resolution spectrum;parameter estimation;spectrally sparse signals;Gaussian noise;bit depth;signal-to-noise ratios;atomic norm soft thresholding;signal recovery;single measurement vector case;multiple measurement vector case;Gaussian measurement model;quantized spectral compressed sensing;Cramer-Rao bounds;cognitive radio;sub-Nyquist sampling schemes;sample complexity;spectral sparsity;spectral signal reconstruction;numerical simulations","","21","","44","IEEE","17 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, this joint design problem requires optimizing over the precoding vector, the precoding factor, and the selected antenna subset. Unfortunately, these design parameters are connected. To address this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm developed from the alternating minimization (AltMin) framework to decouple the considered problem into two subproblems: the precoding factor design problem and the joint AS and the precoding vector design problem. The former can be easily solved approximately, whereas the latter incurs combinatorial complexity. We address this issue by using a simple yet effective coordinate update algorithm (CUA). We also develop a reduced-complexity version of CUA without performance loss. Moreover, the proposed CUA-based AltMin algorithm can be applied to the quantized CE precoding design problems without modification. The simulation results show that the proposed CUA-based AltMin algorithm considerably outperforms the existing algorithms for the quantized CE precoding design problems. In addition, when the AS mechanism is included in the quantized CE precoding design, CUA-AltMin with AS achieves the same or higher performance than CUA-AltMin without AS while providing further power savings.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2923202","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2221-E-017-001-MY2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736945","Alternating minimization;antenna selection;constant envelope precoding;coordinate update algorithm;massive MIMO","Precoding;Antennas;Downlink;Radio frequency;Hardware;Power demand;Approximation algorithms","antenna arrays;iterative methods;MIMO communication;minimisation;multiuser channels;precoding;quadrature amplitude modulation;radiofrequency interference","precoding factor design problem;precoding vector design problem;quantized CE precoding design problems;joint quantized constant envelope precoding;antenna selection;massive MU-MIMO downlink systems;massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems;multiuser interference;hardware power consumption;selected antenna subset;higher-order QAM;alternating minimization framework;combinatorial complexity;coordinate update algorithm;CUA-based AltMin algorithm","","3","","16","CCBY","14 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such models typically incorporate a fine-grained variational autoencoder (VAE) structure, extracting latent features at each input token (e.g., phonemes). However, generating samples with the standard VAE prior often results in unnatural and discontinuous speech, with dramatic prosodic variation between tokens. This paper proposes a sequential prior in a discrete latent space which can generate more naturally sounding samples. This is accomplished by discretizing the latent features using vector quantization (VQ), and separately training an autoregressive (AR) prior model over the result. We evaluate the approach using listening tests, objective metrics of automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance, and measurements of prosody attributes. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly improves the naturalness in random sample generation. Furthermore, initial experiments demonstrate that randomly sampling from the proposed model can be used as data augmentation to improve the ASR performance.","2379-190X","978-1-5090-6631-5","10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9053436","text-to-speech;Tacotron 2;fine-grained VAE","Training;Measurement;Vector quantization;Feature extraction;Data models;Speech processing;Standards","neural nets;speech processing;speech recognition;statistical analysis;text analysis;vector quantisation","natural text-to-speech samples;quantized fine-grained VAE;autoregressive prosody;text-to-speech models;fine-grained latent features;fine-grained variational autoencoder structure;standard VAE;unnatural speech;discontinuous speech;dramatic prosodic variation;discrete latent space;naturally sounding samples;vector quantization;autoregressive prior model;automatic speech recognition;prosody attributes;random sample generation;data augmentation;diverse text-to-speech samples","","23","","29","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a limited feedback model where each user conveys B bits of partial channel information to the BS. Due to the lack of statistical information at the BS, a codebook based on random vector quantization (RVQ) and tailored to uncorrected Rayleigh fading is used in signaling. Our first contribution is to characterize the impact of spatial correlation (in particular, the eigenvalues of the transmit covariance matrix) on the performance of an RVQ scheme. We also show that spatial correlation has significant consequences on practical aspects of limited feedback systems like storage and construction of codebooks. While independent RVQ codebooks have to be generated for the different users in the i.i.d. case, under certain relaxed assumptions on the correlation, the same codebook can be reused across all the users.

The computational requirement due to the encoding search process, had hindered application of VQ to real-time high-quality coding of color TV images. Reduction of the encoding search complexity through partitioning of a large codebook into the on-chip memories of a concurrent VLSI chip set is proposed. A real-time vector quantizer architecture for encoding color images is developed. The architecture maps the mean/quantized residual vector quantizer (MQRVQ) (an extension of mean/residual VQ) onto a VLSI/LSI chip set. The MQRVQ contributes to the feasibility of the VLSI architecture through the use of a simple multiplication free distortion measure and reduction of the required memory per code vector. Running at a clock rate of 25 MHz the proposed hardware implementation of this architecture is capable of real-time processing of 480*768 pixels per frame with a refreshing rate of 30 frames/s. The result is a real-time high-quality composite color image coder operating at a fixed rate of 1.12 b per pixel.<>","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.157193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=157193","","Very large scale integration;Image coding;Color;Computer architecture;Digital images;Vector quantization;TV;Encoding;Large scale integration;Distortion measurement","computerised picture processing;data compression;encoding;real-time systems;video signals;VLSI","codebook partitioning;code vector memory;real-time image coding;vector quantization;color TV images;encoding search complexity;VLSI chip set;mean/quantized residual vector quantizer;MQRVQ;multiplication free distortion measure;clock rate;hardware implementation;refreshing rate;composite color image coder;25 MHz;480 pixels;268 pixels","","20","1","14","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All current line spectral frequency (LSF) vector quantization routines may cause that the resulting quantized LSF vector is out of order, and thus unstable. In those cases the vector is stabilized after the quantization by sorting the LSF vector. This, however, means that the found vector may not be optimal, since this sorting was not taken into account in the quantization loop. The proposed codebook search routine orders the LSF vector inside the quantizer loop, and the optimal code vector is always found. The proposed method improves LSF quantization performance in terms of spectral distortion (SD) while maintaining the original bit allocation. The method can be used both with predictive and non-predictive split (partitioned) vector or multistage vector quantizers. The proposed method has more effect on performance when higher order LPC models or matrix quantizers are used, because in those cases LSFs are closer to each other and invalid ordering is more likely to happen.

The success of quantization during inference has motivated the academic community to explore fully quantized training, i.e. quantizing back-propagation as well. However, effective gradient quantization is still an open problem. Gradients are unbounded and their distribution changes significantly during training, which leads to the need for dynamic quantization. As we show, dynamic quantization can lead to significant memory overhead and additional data traffic slowing down training. We propose a simple alternative to dynamic quantization, in-hindsight range estimation, that uses the quantization ranges estimated on previous iterations to quantize the present. Our approach enables fast static quantization of gradients and activations while requiring only minimal hardware support from the neural network accelerator to keep track of output statistics in an online fashion. It is in-tended as a drop-in replacement for estimating quantization ranges and can be used in conjunction with other advances in quantized training. We compare our method to existing methods for range estimation from the quantized training literature and demonstrate its effectiveness with a range of architectures, including MobileNetV2, on image classification benchmarks (Tiny ImageNet & ImageNet).","2160-7516","978-1-6654-4899-4","10.1109/CVPRW53098.2021.00341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522767","","Training;Quantization (signal);Tensors;Neural networks;Estimation;Dynamic range;Benchmark testing","data analysis;deep learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;parameter estimation;vector quantisation","dynamic quantization;in-hindsight range estimation;quantization ranges;fast static quantization;quantized training literature;hindsight quantization range estimation;quantization techniques;fully quantized training;effective gradient quantization;resource-constraint devices;data traffic","","","","25","IEEE","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve consensus, dither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When the quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels), stochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with probability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that the mean-squared error (mse) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link weight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study dithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is bounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded quantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the supremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is accomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components: one along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to the consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale and supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the excursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the excursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use these probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore tradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization steps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy ¿ away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer design with a numerical study.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2036046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5325701","Bounded quantizer;consensus;convergence;quantized;quantizer saturation;random link failures;sample path behavior;stochastic approximation","Convergence;Quantization;Signal processing algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Network topology;Stochastic resonance;Random variables;Costs;Stochastic processes;Application software","distributed sensors;mean square error methods;statistical analysis","distributed consensus algorithm;sensor networks;quantized data failure;random link failure;distributed average consensus;stochastic approximation;finite random variable;mean squared error;link weight sequence;random links;uniform boundedness;unbounded quantizer;statistical properties;consensus subspace;maximal inequalities;submartingale sequences;supermartingale sequences;probability bound;quantizer state vector","","324","","50","IEEE","10 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of this work is to propose a new scheme for vector quantization of wavelet coefficients. The proposed method is based on lattice vector quantization. The application of the D/sub 4/, E/sub 8/ and Barnes-Wall Lambda /sub 16/ lattices is investigated. These lattices are used to encode wavelet coefficients whose PDFs are close to Laplacian. A variable-length coding method is applied and the trade-off between distortion and optimal rate is investigated. Experimental results on the Lena image using the Lambda /sub 16/ lattice leads to a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 31.14 dB at 0.08 bpp. This result outperforms, to the authors knowledge, all other methods.

A novel scheme for image compression is proposed. Wavelet transform is used to obtain a set of orthonormal subclasses of images. Wavelets are functions that allow the construction of an orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R). The wavelet functions are well localized both in the space and frequency domains. The original image is decomposed on this orthonormal basis with a pyramidal algorithm architecture using quadrature mirror filters. This classification approach separates images (vectors) into perceptually distinct classes and thus matches the visual system model. The wavelet coefficients of each class are then vector quantized. The algorithm is based on a clustering approach and on the minimization of a distortion measure such as mean-squared error (MSE). A global codebook design unfortunately results in edge smoothing.<>","","","10.1109/MDSP.1989.97056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=97056","","Wavelet transforms;Image coding;Vector quantization;Clustering algorithms;Wavelet domain;Frequency domain analysis;Mirrors;Filters;Visual system;Wavelet coefficients","analogue-digital conversion;encoding;picture processing;transforms;wave equations","computational complexity;bit allocation;wavelet transform;image coding;vector quantization;image compression;orthonormal subclasses;orthonormal basis;wavelet functions;pyramidal algorithm architecture;quadrature mirror filters;visual system model;wavelet coefficients;distortion measure;mean-squared error;MSE;codebook","","4","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we study image classification on a much larger dataset of 30 million images, including nearly 2 million of which have been labeled into one of 500 categories. The dataset and categories are formed automatically from geotagged photos from Flickr, by looking for peaks in the spatial geotag distribution corresponding to frequently-photographed landmarks. We learn models for these landmarks with a multiclass support vector machine, using vector-quantized interest point descriptors as features. We also explore the non-visual information available on modern photo-sharing sites, showing that using textual tags and temporal constraints leads to significant improvements in classification rate.

Moreover, after each editing step, any video object is almost always encoded in order to store it using a less amount of memory. For this reason, inferring the number of compression steps that have been applied to such a multimedia object is an important clue in order to assess its authenticity. In this paper we propose a method to recover the number of compression steps applied to a video sequence. In order to accomplish this goal, we make use of a classifier based on multiple Support Vector Machines (SVM) exploiting the Benford's law. Indeed, the feature vectors used to train and test the SVM are based on the statistics of the most significant digit of quantized transform coefficients. The proposed method is tested with a generic hybrid video encoder combining motion-compensation and block coding. Results show that this method is able to discriminate up to three compression stages with high accuracy.","","978-1-4673-4572-9","10.1109/MMSP.2012.6343425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6343425","","Quantization;Support vector machines;Encoding;Video sequences;Image coding;Vectors;Training","data compression;feature extraction;image sequences;motion compensation;signal classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines;transforms;video coding","multiple compression detection;video sequence editing;video object encoding;multimedia object;authenticity assessment;compression step number recovery;multiple support vector machine classifier;SVM;Benford law;feature vectors;statistics;quantized transform coefficient;generic hybrid video encoder;motion compensation;block coding","","36","","15","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Zero forcing DPC (ZF-DPC) is a sub-optimal way to achieve DPC by triagularizing the channel. In our previous work, we had proposed an enhancement of ZF-DPC by introducing additional receiver which was shown to improve the achievable rates over linear schemes such as block diagonalization. In practise Block Diagonalization is implemented by the receiver feeding back quantized information about the channel and the transmitter figuring out the precoders subsequently. To establish a comparison of ZF-DPC to Block Diagonalization for such practical feedback, we first derive the framework for operating ZF-DPC with quantized feedback.

Though vector quantizers are more efficient than scalar quantizers, their use for accurate quantization of linear predictive coding (LPC) information (using 24-26 bits/frame) is impeded by their prohibitively high complexity. A split vector quantization approach is used here to overcome the complexity problem. An LPC vector consisting of 10 line spectral frequencies (LSFs) is divided into two parts, and each part is quantized separately using vector quantization. Using the localized spectral sensitivity property of the LSF parameters, a weighted LSF distance measure is proposed. With this distance measure, it is shown that the split vector quantizer can quantize LPC information in 24 bits/frame with an average spectral distortion of 1 dB and less than 2% of the frames having spectral distortion greater than 2 dB. The effect of channel errors on the performance of this quantizer is also investigated and results are reported.<>","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.221363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=221363","","Vector quantization;Linear predictive coding;Bit rate;Speech coding;Distortion measurement;Speech processing;Speech analysis;Impedance;Frequency conversion;Weight measurement","linear predictive coding;speech coding;vector quantisation","speech coding;LPC parameters;linear predictive coding;split vector quantization;LPC vector;line spectral frequencies;localized spectral sensitivity;LSF parameters;LSF distance measure;average spectral distortion;channel;performance;24 bit","","416","51","38","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this method, the mean values for short ECG signal segments are quantized as scalars and compression of the single-lead ECG by average beat substraction and residual differencing their waveshapes coded through a vector quantizer. An entropy encoder is applied to both, mean and vector codes, to further increase compression without degrading the quality of the reconstructed signals. In this paper, the fundamentals of MSVQ are discussed, along with various parameters specifications such as duration of signal segments, the wordlength of the mean-value quantization and the size of the vector codebook. The method is assessed through percent-residual-difference measures on reconstructed signals, whereas its computational complexity is analyzed considering its real-time implementation. As a result, MSVQ has been found to be an efficient compression method, leading to high compression ratios (CRs) while maintaining a low level of waveform distortion and, consequently, preserving the main clinically interesting features of the ECG signals. CRs in excess of 39 have been achieved, yielding low data rates of about 140 bps.

The adaptability of the approach can be used to control the quality of reconstructed signals. However, like most of other ECG compression methods, AVQ only deals with the single-channel ECG, and for the multichannel (MC) ECG, coding ECG signals on a channel by channel basis is not efficient, because the correlation across channels is not exploited. To exploit this correlation, an MC version of AVQ is proposed. In the proposed approach, the AVQ index from each channel is collected to form a new input vector. The vector is then vector quantized adaptively using one additional codebook called index codebook. Both the MIT/BIH database and a clinical Holter database are tested. The experimental results show that, for exactly the same quality of reconstructed signals, the MC-AVQ performs better than single-channel AVQ in terms of bit rate. A theoretical analysis supporting this result is also demonstrated in this paper.

The scheme has the capability of the rate control with no need for changing the codebooks and reveals good performance over a wide range of code rates.

(ii) Perfect and imperfect low-frequency tail cancellation cases are considered. (iii) High-frequency signal shaping and its interaction with the predominantly low-frequency tail are taken into account. Expressions for error probability on the kth digit are derived in terms of the kth vector iterate of a known function. The restriction to independent noise samples is also removed.

Here we analyze the performance of random vector quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed entries. We assume that channel elements are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and known to the receiver, which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go to infinity with fixed ratios. RVQ for beamforming is asymptotically optimal, i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers (matched filter and minimum mean squared error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched filter can require significantly more feedback.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2008.2011437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787627","Beamforming;large system analysis;limited feedback;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO);precoding;vector quantization","Fading;Feedback;MIMO;Quantization;Array signal processing;Matched filters;Performance analysis;Relays;Transmitters;Receiving antennas","antenna arrays;channel capacity;channel coding;fading channels;least mean squares methods;matched filters;matrix algebra;MIMO communication;precoding;vector quantisation","multiple-antenna fading channel capacity;quantized precoding matrix;multiple-input multiple-output;MIMO channel feedback;transmit precoding matrix;random vector quantization;random codebook;beamforming system capacity;linear receivers;matched filter;minimum mean squared error;MMSE;finite-size systems;target spectral efficiency","","114","5","47","IEEE","24 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has robustness against ship deformation due to changing aspect angles and loss of ship parts caused by occlusion. To deal with the deformation and the loss, we extract a feature vector from a ship in an ISAR image by Co-occurrence Histograms of Oriented Gradients (CoHOG). An ISAR ship image is divided into multiple blocks and CoHOG is extracted from pairs of quantized gradient orientations in each of the blocks. Quantized orientations are not changed by slight deformation of a ship. This property derives that CoHOG has robustness against the deformation due to changing aspect angles. Variation of CoHOG caused by occlusion is small since gradient orientations are changed in only blocks including occluded parts. On the other hand, combinations of pairs of orientations make dimension of CoHOG extremely high. We calculate a similarity between two ships using Random Ensemble Metric (REMetric), which is a metric learning method for a high dimensional feature space. It has multiple Support Vector Machines (SVM) learnt from randomly subsampled training data, and calculates a similarity between two vectors from results of SVM of these two vectors. Since SVM finds a hyperplane which has maximum margin between two classes, its classification performance is high even through dimension of a feature space is high. Through experiments with simulated ISAR ships images, we show our method has robustness against aspect angle changes and occlusion, and it has higher performance than a conventional method.","2375-5318","978-1-4673-0658-4","10.1109/RADAR.2012.6212258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212258","","Marine vehicles;Vectors;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Measurement;Histograms;Robustness","image recognition;radar computing;radar imaging;ships;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","automatic ship recognition robust;aspect angle changes;occlusions;inverse synthetic aperture radar;ship deformation;co-occurrence histograms of oriented gradients;CoHOG;ISAR ship image;quantized orientations;random ensemble metric;REMetric;support vector machines;SVM;randomly subsampled training data","","8","","9","","7 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

QCPX not only supports a packed 16-bit YCbCr data format but also obtains performance and code density improvements through three-color pixels in parallel in a 16-bit width. To measure execution performance of the QCPX instruction set architecture (ISA), it is evaluated in a SIMD pixel array platform developed at Georgia Tech. In addition, by varying the grain size (pixel per processing element, PPE), this study can fully measure the impact of QCPX in the presence of different levels of data parallelism. Simulation results indicate that QCPX version achieves speedups from 27% to 297% over non-QCPX with the most impressive improvements >200 % occurring above the communication-bound 16 PPE granularity. QCPX also reduces average PE idle cycles by 45%.

This paper presents an efficient method of finding the operational rate-distortion (RD) optimal set of coefficients. The major complexity reduction lies in the reformulation of the original RD-tradeoff problem, where a new set of coefficients is used as decision variables. These coefficients are connected to the orthogonalization of the set of selected frame vectors and not to the frame vectors themselves.

However, to apply high dimensional methodologies such as vector quantization, controlling a multidimensional latent space is necessary. In this study, among the VAE-based models that use relatively complex multidimensional latent spaces, we apply an Energy-Based Model and Vector-Quantized VAE v2, with the latter as the main model. We show that among the latent spaces that represent each image domain, the importance of each feature at the top and bottom latent spaces must be interpreted differently for appropriate translation.

Adopting tools of stochastic geometry, we firstly, provide a tight approximation of the coverage performance of quantized SDMA beamforming in a closed-form that encompasses impacts of feedback capacity, density of BSs, and SIR thresholds under max-SIR cell association rule. Assuming CQI of each UE is its experienced SIR, we then exploit our analysis to devise a proper optimization problem to adaptively share feedback capacity between tiers, and also between CDI and CQI feedback. We do so by introducing net spatial throughput (NST) as the main performance metric, which is defined as the spatial throughput minus uplink penalty of feedback capacity per area per frame. Our numerical results show that serving more UEs calls for higher capacity of feedback channel without delivering strong NST.

Since the actual probability distributions of image or voice data is not known, the vector quantizers are trained with long sequences of image or voice data known as a training sequence. Various distortion measures are present for quantizing the data. This paper aims at suggesting the implementation of three types of distortions (squared error distortion, linear distortion and piece-wise linear distortion), measuring and comparing the efficiency of each of the techniques in terms of average distortion and time for each measure. Quantization is of two types: scalar quantization and vector quantization. Scalar quantization is a phenomenon on which, each pixel is quantized either by reducing the number of gray levels or by reducing the resolution. Vector quantization is one in which the whole image is divided into several blocks and a code vector replaces each block. The main principle involved in the vector quantization is the clustering technique, which is applied to generate an optimal codebook for the given training sequence. After quantizing the training sequence the authors obtain a codebook which optimally represents the probability distribution of intensities in images. This work mainly concentrates on vector quantization, based on a long training sequence of data. Methods are discussed to reduce computational complexity of the vector quantizer algorithm, thereby making the codebook design faster. The quantizer designed in the authors' work reduces the psychovisual redundancy present in an image data by quantizing the data. This module can be used in the quantizer step of the overall image compressor.","","0-7803-5207-6","10.1109/IGARSS.1999.775100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=775100","","Image coding;Vector quantization;Distortion measurement;Probability distribution;Time measurement;Piecewise linear techniques;Computational complexity;Algorithm design and analysis;Psychology;Redundancy","geophysical techniques;terrain mapping;remote sensing;geophysical signal processing;vector quantisation;data compression;quantisation (signal);image coding","geophysical measurement technique;land surface;terrain mapping;remote sensing;image coding;data compression;quantization;image compression;vector quantizer;optimal quantizer;training;squared error distortion;linear distortion;piece-wise linear distortion;scalar quantization;vector quantization","","","","3","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach is robust with respect to channel noise even if we do not use any error control scheme in the communication system. Afterwards, a new trellis type quantizer, namely, the trellis coded Kohonen (1984) map (TCKM), is presented. The design process of the TCKM, which is based on the neighborhood structure of SOFMs, is simpler than that of conventional trellis coded vector quantizers (TCVQs). Simulation results show that the performance of TCKMs is comparable with that of TCVQs. Last, we introduce the error control scheme based on the concepts of the above two applications of SOFMs. Simulation results show that the proposed error control scheme is more robust with respect to channel noise. The advantage of our approaches mentioned above is that the design processes of transmission systems are predefined before the construction of the codebook.

Earlier work addressed this problem by clustering the multiple sources into a small number of source groups, where each group shares a codebook. As a natural generalization, we propose the design of a size-limited universal codebook consisting of the union of overlapping source codebooks. This framework allows each source codebook to consist of any desired subset of the universal codevectors and provides greater design flexibility which improves the storage-constrained performance. Further advantages of the proposed approach include the fact that no two sources need be encoded at the same rate, and the close relation to universal, adaptive, and classified quantization. Necessary conditions for optimality of the universal codebook and the extracted source codebooks are derived.

"The search accuracy of tree-structured VQ","J. Lin","Department of Computer Scienc, Eastern Connecticut State University, Willimantic, CT, USA","Proceedings DCC '97. Data Compression Conference","6 Aug 2002","1997","","","451","","Summary form only given. It is well-known that tree-structured vector quantization may sacrifice performance for reduced computation. The performance loss can be attributed to two separate sources, the design approximation and the search inaccuracy. To measure the search performance, we define the search accuracy as the percentage of input vectors that are quantized with minimum distortion. Our studies show that low search accuracy is the main cause of performance loss for some of the best current tree-structured vector quantizers. Although the design approximation and search performance can be analyzed separately, we observe that the result of design may actually affect the search accuracy. Most of the current design techniques seek to minimize the distortion in the design without any consideration of their effect on the search. The tree search accuracy as a result of these designs could be as low as 50 percent. In order to improve the overall performance, the tree design should not be optimized without consideration of tree search accuracy. The difficulty is that it is not possible to measure the search accuracy at the design stage. We develop a design algorithm that incorporates the search accuracy and produce a tree-structured that improves the search accuracy significantly. Experimental results in image compression show that the strategy works surprisingly well in improving the tree search accuracy from a low of 50% to over 80 and 90%.","1068-0314","0-8186-7761-9","10.1109/DCC.1997.582112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=582112","","Performance loss;Entropy;Computer science;Computed tomography;Vector quantization;Distortion measurement;Performance analysis;Design optimization;Algorithm design and analysis;Image coding","vector quantisation;tree searching;image coding","tree-structured VQ;vector quantization;performance loss;search performance;search inaccuracy;input vectors;minimum distortion;design approximation;tree search accuracy;design algorithm;experimental results;image compression","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We therefore consider the limited feedback scheme with random vector quantization (RVQ), where the ST can only know the quantized channel direction information (CDI). Considering the statistics of the CSI quantization error and the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) receiver, we derive the closed-form MSE expressions corresponding to the PU and the SU. With the derived MSEs, we propose two robust design criteria. One criterion is to minimize the ST's power consumption under the constraint that the PU's and SU's quality-of-service (QoS; i.e., MSE) can be met. The other criterion is to minimize the SU's MSE when the PU's QoS can be controlled under a certain value and the ST satisfies the limitation of its transmission power consumption. Both the optimization problems of the proposed design criteria are not convex, and the corresponding solutions cannot be directly obtained. We then propose transfering the original optimization problems into two subproblems, where each of them is eventually formulated as a convex optimization problem, and the solutions are iteratively obtained, which is effective. Thus, the results can be obtained with the interior-point method. Simulations certify the robustness of our designs.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2013.2296594","National Science Council(grant numbers:NSC 102-2221-E-110-030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6697840","Index TermsIndex Terms- Cognitive overlay transceiver design;amplify-and-forward (AF);cooperative relaying;robust design;channel state information (CSI);random vector quantization (RVQ);linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE);Amplify-and-forward (AF);channel state information (CSI);cognitive overlay transceiver design;cooperative relaying;linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE);random vector quantization (RVQ);robust design","Quantization (signal);Transceivers;Shape;Receivers;Robustness;Quality of service;Interference","amplify and forward communication;convex programming;cooperative communication;least mean squares methods;precoding;quality of service;quantisation (signal);radio spectrum management;radio transceivers;telecommunication power management","robust multiple-antenna cooperative spectrum sharing design;random vector quantization;cognitive overlay transceiver designs;primary transceiver pair;secondary transceiver pair;primary user;secondary user;cooperative amplify-and-forward;AF;precoders;PU;SU;secondary transmitter;ST;channel state information;RVQ;quantized channel direction information;CSI quantization error;linear minimum mean square error receiver;LMMSE receiver;closed-form MSE expressions;robust design criteria;quality-of-service;MSE;QoS;transmission power consumption;convex optimization;interior-point method","","5","","34","OAPA","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to reduce the required number of feedback bits by applying a common transmit beamformer for a cluster of adjacent subcarriers. The sum capacity over all subcarriers depends on a cluster size, the number of feedback bits, and the number of channel taps. Approximation of the optimal cluster size that maximizes the sum rates is derived and is shown to predict simulation results very well.

A closed-loop procedure is used to select the sub-vectors. The overlapping between the selected vectors are allowed to prevent the pitch peak splitting.

This paper provides new insights into the problem of optimal signal detection based on quantized received signals for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. It capitalizes on previous works which extensively analyzed the unquantized linear vector channel using graphical inference methods. In particular, a “loopy” belief propagation-like (BP) MIMO detection algorithm, operating on quantized data with low complexity, is proposed. In addition, we study the impact of finite receiver resolution in fading channels in the large-system limit by means of a state evolution analysis of the BP algorithm, which refers to the limit where the number of transmit and receive antennas go to infinity with a fixed ratio.

Those signal estimation techniques guarantee a perfect matching between the available quantized data and a new observation of the estimated signal under the same sensing model. Focusing on dithered uniform scalar quantization of resolution δ > 0, we prove first that, given a Gaussian random frame of RN with M vectors, the worst-case ℓ2-error of consistent signal reconstruction decays with high probability as O((N/M) log(M/√N)) uniformly for all signals of the unit ball BN ⊂ RN. Up to a log factor, this matches a known lower bound in Ω(N/M) and former empirical validations in O(N/M). Equivalently, if M exceeds a minimal number of frame coefficients growing like O((N)/(ε0) log(√N)/(E0)), any vectors in BN with M identical quantized projections are at most E0 apart with high probability. Second, in the context of quantized compressed sensing with M Gaussian random measurements and under the same scalar quantization scheme, consistent reconstructions of K-sparse signals of RN have a worst case error that decreases with high probability as O((K)/(M) log(MN)/(√K3)) uniformly for all such signals. Finally, we show that the proximity of vectors whose quantized random projections are only approximately consistent can still be bounded with high probability. A certain level of corruption is thus allowed in the quantization process, up to the appearance of a systematic bias in the reconstruction error of (almost) consistent signal estimates.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2016.2573313","Belgian National Science Foundation (F.R.S.–FNRS, Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7479514","Compressive sensing;estimation error;quantization (signal);quantization consistency;Buffon’s dumbbell;dithering","Quantization (signal);Sensors;Reconstruction algorithms;Manganese;Context;Image reconstruction;Estimation","compressed sensing;Gaussian processes;quantisation (signal);signal reconstruction;signal resolution","consistent signal estimation error decay;quantized Gaussian random projection;error bounds;resolution uniform scalar quantization;Gaussian random frame;consistent signal reconstruction decay;quantized compressed sensing;Gaussian random measurement;scalar quantization scheme","","4","","38","IEEE","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We address the problem of optimum secondary transmit power allocation for its ergodic capacity maximization subject to an average sum (across the bands) transmit power constraint and individual average interference constraints on the primary users. The major contribution of our work lies in considering quantized channel state information (CSI) (for the vector channel space consisting of all secondary-to-secondary and secondary-to-primary channels) at the secondary transmitter as opposed to the prevalent assumption of full CSI in most existing work. It is assumed that a central entity called a cognitive radio network manager has access to the full CSI information from the secondary and primary receivers and designs (offline) an optimal power codebook based on the statistical information (channel distributions) of the channels and feeds back the index of the codebook to the secondary transmitter for every channel realization in real-time, via a delay-free noiseless limited feedback channel. A modified Generalized Lloyds-type algorithm (GLA) is designed for deriving the optimal power codebook, which is proved to be globally convergent and empirically consistent. An approximate quantized power allocation (AQPA) algorithm is presented, that performs very close to its GLA based counterpart for large number of feedback bits and is significantly faster. We also present an extension of the modified GLA based quantized power codebook design algorithm for the case when the feedback channel is noisy. Numerical studies illustrate that with only 3-4 bits of feedback per band, the modified GLA based algorithms provide secondary ergodic capacity very close to that achieved by full CSI and with only as little as 4 bits of feedback per band, AQPA provides a comparable performance, thus making it an attractive choice for practical implementation.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2011.042811.100337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764601","Cognitive radio;spectrum sharing;fading channels;ergodic capacity;finite-rate feedback","Resource management;Algorithm design and analysis;Cognitive radio;Interference;Approximation algorithms;Wideband;Channel estimation","channel allocation;cognitive radio;power electronics;quantisation (signal)","spectrum sharing cognitive radio network;wideband spectrum sharing system;orthogonal frequency band;ergodic capacity maximization;quantized channel state information;optimal power codebook;statistical information;channel distribution;channel realization;delay-free noiseless limited feedback channel;generalized Lloyds-type algorithm;approximate quantized power allocation algorithm;quantized power codebook design algorithm","","39","","26","","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel method to classify brain abnormalities (tumor and stroke) in MRI images using a hybridized machine learning algorithm. The proposed methodology includes feature extraction (texture, intensity, and shape), feature selection, and classification. The texture features are extracted by intending a neoteric directional-based quantized extrema pattern. The intensity features are extracted by proposing the clustering-based wavelet transform. The shape-based extraction is performed using conventional shape descriptors. Maximum A Priori (MAP) based firefly algorithm is proposed for feature selection. Finally, hybridized support vector-based random forest classifier is used for the classification. The MRI brain tumor and stroke images are detected and categorized into four classes which are a high-grade tumor, a low-grade tumor, an acute stroke, and a sub-acute stroke. Besides, three different regions are identified in tumor detection such as edema, and tumor (necrotic and non-enhancing) region. The accuracy of the proposed method is analyzed using various performance metrics in comparison with the few state-of-the-art classification methods. The proposed methodology successfully achieves a reliable accuracy of 88.3% for classifying brain tumor cases and 99.2% for brain stroke classification. The best F-score of 0.91 and the least FPR of 0.06 are attained while considering brain tumor classification against the proposed HSVFC.

In this article, we propose a cycle vector-quantized variational autoencoder (cycle-VQ-VAE) framework to encode and decode the video with its extracted audio, which takes the advantage of multiple heterogeneous data sources in the video itself to protect individuals’ privacy. In our cycle-VQ-VAE framework, a fusion mechanism is designed to integrate the video and its extracted audio. Particularly, the extracted audio works as the random noise with a nonpatterned distribution, which outperforms the noise that follows a patterned distribution for hiding visual information in the video. Under this framework, we design two models, including the frame-to-frame (F2F) model and video-to-video (V2V) model, to obtain privacy-preserving video streaming. In F2F, the video is processed as a sequence of frames; while, in V2V, the relations between frames are utilized to deal with the video, greatly improving the performance of privacy protection, video compression, and video reconstruction. Moreover, the video streaming is compressed in our encoding process, which can resist side-channel inference attack during video transmission and reduce video transmission time. Through the real-data experiments, we validate the superiority of our models (F2F and V2V) over the existing methods in visual privacy protection, visual quality preservation, and video transmission efficiency.

Existing works consider multiple-input-single-output (MISO) channels across all frequencies (subcarriers) of a certain bandwidth, where high compression ratios can be achieved due to the structure of the channels across the frequency domain, or due to their sparsity in the time domain. With this work, we take into account that in reality, the channels cannot be observed for all the subcarriers inside the bandwidth, therefore, it is crucial to compress the channels considering a single subcarrier observation. Simulation results demonstrate that transformers can be used to construct efficient autoencoders with a reduced amount of parameters. Furthermore, we show that embedding the quantization during the training, using the VQ-VAE framework, helps to achieve better performances compared to a post-training quantization based on standard techniques.","","978-1-6654-5426-1","10.1109/DSLW53931.2022.9820270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9820270","Transformers;autoencoders;vector quantized variational autoencoders;MIMO systems;FDD systems","Training;Time-frequency analysis;Quantization (signal);Simulation;Bandwidth;MISO communication;Transformers","learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;MISO communication;neural nets;telecommunication computing;time-frequency analysis;vectors;wireless channels","multiple-input-single-output channels;frequency domain analysis;time domain analysis;single subcarrier observation;transformers;VQ-VAE framework;compression techniques;MIMO channels;FDD systems;vector quantized variational autoencoders;multiple-input-multiple-output channels;frequency-division-duplex systems;MISO channels;post-training quantization","","","","37","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quantizers have been designed for each of the visual subband by evaluating the perception of quantization impairments on natural images. The images have been characterized by the local bandlimited contrast. It has been shown that these images must always be uniformly quantized in order to achieve a just noticeable quantization noise.

In this study, a new error resilient coding scheme for JPEG image transmission based on data embedding and side-match vector quantization (VQ) is proposed. To cope with the synchronization problem, the restart capability of JPEG images is enabled. The objective of the proposed scheme is to recover high-quality JPEG images from the corresponding corrupted images. At the encoder, the important data (the codebook index) for each Y (U or V) block in a JPEG image are extracted and embedded into another ""masking"" Y (U or V) block in the image by the odd-even data embedding scheme. At the decoder, after all the corrupted blocks within a JPEG image are detected and located, if the important data for a corrupted block can be extracted correctly from the corresponding ""masking"" block, the extracted important data will be used to conceal, the corrupted block; otherwise, the side-match VQ technique is employed to conceal the corrupted block. Based on the simulation results, the performance of the proposed scheme is better than that of five existing approaches for comparison. The proposed scheme can recover high-quality JPEG images from the corresponding corrupted images up to a block loss rate of 30%.","","0-7803-7761-3","10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1206028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206028","","Image coding;Image communication;Vector quantization;Decoding;Data mining;Error correction;Degradation;Transform coding;Computer errors;Computer science","vector quantisation;visual communication;synchronisation;entropy codes;coding errors;discrete cosine transforms;error detection;error correction;image coding","error resilient coding scheme;JPEG image transmission;entropy-coded JPEG image;transmission error;data embedding;side-match vector quantization;side-match VQ technique;synchronization problem;restart capability;high-quality JPEG image recovery;quantized DCT coefficients","","4","","15","","25 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this scheme, signal vector is formed with one sample of the normalized prediction error signal coming from different subbands and then it is vector quantized. The prediction error signal is normalized by its gain and normalized prediction error signal is the input of the VQ and therefore an adaptive gain-shape VQ is considered. This APVQ encoder combines the advantages of scalar prediction and those of vector quantization.

We study two nonlinear interpolative techniques for text image interpolation. These nonlinear interpolation methods map quantized low dimensional 2/spl times/2 image blocks to higher dimensional 4/spl times/4 (possibly binary) blocks using a table lookup operation. The first method performs interpolation of text images using context-based, nonlinear, interpolative, vector quantization (NLIVQ). This system has a simple training procedure and has performance (for gray-level high resolution images) that is comparable to our more sophisticated generalized interpolative VQ (GIVQ) approach, which is the second method. In it, we jointly optimize the quantizer and interpolator to find matched codebooks for the low and high resolution images. Then, to obtain the binary codebook that incorporates binarization with interpolation, we introduce a binary constrained optimization method using GIVQ. In order to incorporate the nearest neighbor constraint on the quantizer while minimizing the distortion in the interpolated image, a deterministic-annealing-based optimization technique is applied. With a few interpolation examples, we demonstrate the superior performance of this method over the NLIVQ method (especially for binary outputs) and other standard techniques e.g., bilinear interpolation and pixel replication.","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.847839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847839","","Vector quantization;Interpolation;Image resolution;Spline;Nearest neighbor searches;Filters;Image reconstruction;Table lookup;Optimization methods;Nonlinear distortion","image coding;vector quantisation;interpolation;optimisation;table lookup;image resolution;text analysis","generalized interpolative vector quantization;optimal quantization;nonlinear interpolation;binarization;gray level text images;high resolution binary image;image reconstruction;text image interpolation;table lookup operation;nonlinear interpolative vector quantization;context-based VQ;training procedure;gray-level high resolution images;generalized interpolative VQ;GIVQ;NLIVQ;matched codebooks;low resolution image;binary codebook;binary constrained optimization method;nearest neighbor constraint;interpolated image;deterministic-annealing-based optimization;performance;bilinear interpolation;pixel replication","","1","","25","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The base station (BS) sends training signals to the users, and every user estimates the channel coefficients, quantizes the gain and the direction of the estimated channel and sends them back to the BS. Suppose that the channel state information at the transmitter is imperfectly known mainly due to the channel direction quantization errors, channel estimation errors and outdated channel effects. The actual channel is modeled as in an uncertainty set composed of two inequality homogeneous and one equality inhomogeneous quadratic constraints, in order to account for the aforementioned errors and effects. Then the transmit power minimization problem is formulated subject to robust signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio constraints. Each robust constraint is transformed equivalently into a quadratic matrix inequality (QMI) constraint with respect to the beamforming vectors. The transformation is accomplished by an equivalent phase rotation process and the strong duality result for a quadratically constrained quadratic program. The minimization problem is accordingly turned into a QMI problem, and the problem is solved by a restricted linear matrix inequality relaxation with additional valid convex constraints.

It has the advantages of high robustness, low computational complexity, model simplicity, and online learning ability. Unfortunately, as input data grows, its dictionary size increases and the computational complexity rises significantly. In addition, how to improve the adaptability in uncertain environments with noise is also one of the main challenges. In this paper, we propose a Quantized Kernel Least-mean-square Based on Echo State Network (ES-QKLMS) algorithm in response to the above problems. In the new algorithm, the reservoirs of the echo state network (ESN) are integrated with the KLMS algorithm for online prediction. The ESN reservoir can store the associated information of historical data, which improves the algorithm's ability to track temporal characteristics.

Kernel least mean square (KLMS) has been extended to multiple kernels recently using different approaches, one of which is mixture kernel least mean square (MxKLMS). Although this method addresses the kernel selection problem, and improves the performance, it suffers from a problem of linearly growing dictionary like in KLMS. In this paper, we present the quantized MxKLMS (QMxKLMS) algorithm to achieve sub-linear growth in dictionary. This method quantizes the input space based on the conventional criteria using Euclidean distance in input space as well as a new criteria using Euclidean distance in RKHS induced by the sum kernel. The empirical results suggest that QMxKLMS using the latter metric is suitable in a non-stationary environment with abruptly changing modes as they are able to utilize the information regarding the relative importance of kernels. Moreover, the QMxKLMS using both metrics are compared with the QKLMS and the existing multi-kernel methods MKLMS and MKNLMS-CS, showing an improved performance over these methods.","2161-4407","978-1-4799-1484-5","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889975","","Kernel;Quantization (signal);Dictionaries;Frequency modulation;Euclidean distance;Vectors","algorithm theory","quantized mixture kernel least mean square;multiple kernels;kernel algorithms;kernel selection problem;quantized MxKLMS;QMxKLMS algorithm;dictionary;Euclidean distance;latter metric;nonstationary environment;multikernel methods MKLMS;MKNLMS-CS","","6","","13","","4 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Low bit-rate speech coding is achieved by efficiently constraining the allowed frequencies of sinusoidal components into sets of frequency intervals or bins. In conjunction with the closed-loop analysis, the constrained frequency regions allow us to efficiently vector quantize the frequency information in each frame. In voiced frames, two sets of frequency vectors are generated: one for harmonically related components and the other for non-harmonically related components of the voiced segment. In transition frames, a vector of nonuniformly spaced frequencies is selected from a frequency codebook using frequency bin vector quantization (FBVQ) to represent the frequency domain information. The effectiveness of the coding scheme is enhanced by exploiting the critical band concept of auditory perception in defining the frequency bins. In transition segments, the sinusoidal phases are modeled and coded. Subjective tests with a partially quantized model indicate that, for a target rate of 4 kbps, the coder quality exceeds that of the G.729 standard at 8 kbps.","1520-6149","0-7803-6293-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2000.861834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=861834","","Speech coding;Speech analysis;Vector quantization;Frequency domain analysis;Testing;Speech synthesis;Matching pursuit algorithms;Predictive models;Data mining;Information analysis","speech coding;hearing;vector quantisation;frequency-domain analysis;frequency-domain synthesis;phase coding","speech coding;analysis-by-synthesis sinusoidal model;closed-loop analysis-by-synthesis technique;AbS technique;low bit-rate coding;constrained frequency regions;vector quantization;VQ;voiced frames;frequency vectors;harmonically related components;nonharmonically related components;transition frames;nonuniformly spaced frequencies;frequency codebook;frequency bin vector quantization;FBVQ;frequency domain information;auditory perception;transition segments;sinusoidal phases;subjective tests;partially quantized model;4 kbit/s","","5","2","7","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Assuming perfect localization, the LS estimation substantially decreases the MSE between the transmitted and reconstructed sequences, regardless of the magnitude of channel error to quantization noise ratio.

This paper proposes a novel method to compress vectors of high precision weights of DNNs to ternary vectors, namely a cosine similarity based target non-retraining ternary (TNT) compression method. Our method leverages cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distances as commonly used in the literature and succeeds in reducing the size of the search space to find optimal ternary vectors from 3N to N, where N is the dimension of target vectors. As a result, the computational complexity for TNT to find theoretically optimal ternary vectors is only O(Nlog(N)).

The mainstream edge learning approach, federated learning, has been developed based on distributed gradient descent. Based on the approach, stochastic gradients are computed at edge devices and then transmitted to an edge server for updating a global AI model. Since each stochastic gradient is typically high-dimensional, communication overhead becomes a bottleneck for edge learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework of hierarchical gradient quantization and study its effect on the learning performance. First, the framework features a practical hierarchical architecture for decomposing the stochastic gradient into its norm and normalized block gradients, and efficiently quantizes them using a uniform quantizer and a low-dimensional Grassmannian codebook, respectively. Subsequently, the quantized normalized block gradients are scaled and cascaded to yield the quantized normalized stochastic gradient using a socalled hinge vector, which is compressed using another low-dimensional Grassmannian quantizer designed under the criterion of minimum distortion. The other feature of the framework is a bit-allocation scheme for reducing the distortion, which divides the total quantization bits to determine the resolutions of low-dimensional quantizers. The framework is proved to guarantee model convergency by analyzing the convergence rate as a function of quantization bits. Furthermore, by simulation, our design is shown to substantially reduce the communication overhead compared with the state-of-the-art signSGD scheme, while achieving similar learning accuracies.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2020.2983166","Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:17208319,17209917); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050465","Vector quantization;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);distributed algorithms","Quantization (signal);Stochastic processes;Convergence;Distortion;Fasteners;Servers;Manifolds","gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;stochastic processes;vector quantisation","communication overhead;hierarchical gradient quantization;uniform quantizer;low-dimensional Grassmannian codebook;quantized normalized block gradients;quantized normalized stochastic gradient;low-dimensional Grassmannian quantizer;total quantization bits;low-dimensional quantizers;high-dimensional stochastic gradient quantization;communication-efficient edge learning;edge machine learning;wireless network edge;federated learning;distributed gradient descent;edge devices;edge server;mobile data;hinge vector;bit-allocation scheme;signSGD scheme","","31","","31","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such vector quantizers have been widely used in the areas of speech coding and speech recognition. The conventional vector quantizer utilizes only spectral shape information and essentially disregards the energy or gain term associated with the optimal LPC fit to the signal being modelled. In this paper we present a method of incorporating LPC spectral shape and energy into the codebook entries of the vector quantizer. To do this we postulate a distortion measure for comparing two LPC vectors which uses a weighted sum of an LPC shape distortion and a log energy distortion. Based on this combined distortion measure we have designed and studied vector quantizers of several sizes for use in isolated word speech recognition experiments. We have found that a fairly significant correlation exists between LPC shape and signal energy; hence a combined LPC shape plus energy vector quantizer with a given distortion requires far fewer codebook entries than one in which LPC shape and energy are quantized separately. Based on isolated word recognition tests on both a 10-digit and a 129 word airlines vocabulary, we have found improvements in recognition accuracy by using the VQ with both LPC shape and energy over that obtained using a VQ with LPC shape alone.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.1984.1172561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1172561","","Linear predictive coding;Distortion measurement;Spectral shape;Speech recognition;Shape measurement;Vector quantization;Speech coding;Energy measurement;Size measurement;Testing","","","","6","","6","","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper considers a precoding optimization problem for maximizing EE in quantized downlink massive MIMO systems. To this end, we jointly optimize an active antenna set, precoding vectors, and allocated power; yet acquiring such joint optimal solution is challenging. To resolve this challenge, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power optimization problems. For precoding direction, we characterize the first-order optimality condition, which entails the effects of quantization distortion and antenna selection. We cast the derived condition as a functional eigenvalue problem, wherein finding the principal eigenvector attains the best local optimal point. To this end, we propose generalized power iteration based algorithm. To optimize precoding power for given precoding direction, we adopt a gradient descent algorithm for the EE maximization. Alternating these two methods, our algorithm identifies a joint solution of the active antenna set, the precoding direction, and allocated power. In simulations, the proposed methods provide considerable performance gains.

The LPC analysis is efficiently performed using a type of binary-tree search vector-quantization approach. The technique, which is described in ref (1), uses a set of hyperplane equations to perform a hierarchical pattern classification of the input autocorrelation vector in the autocorrelation space. The end result of the search is the integer i1which is the index of the most appropriate (in the Itakura-distance sense) prediction filter out of a set of N preset filters. The search requires only\Log_{2}Ndot products. In this case vector quantization presents two advantages over the classical approach of the Durbin algorithm followed by scalar quantization. First, a faster algorithm is obtained. Second, the same accuracy in filter representation is possible with less bits per second and consequently more bits can be allocated for representing the residual and gain. The residual is vector quantized in the time domain by blocks of 16 the samples according to the approach of ref (2). The 16 sample block is essentially encoded using the integer I2which is the index of the most appropriate 16-sample waveform out of set of M preset prototype waveforms stored in memory. The paper includes preference testings for comparison with other types of 4800 Kbit/sec vocoders. Some sample recordings will be presented at the conference.

The scalar components of the vector are individually quantized in a sequence, with the quantization of each component utilizing conditional information from the quantization of previous components. Unlike conventional independent scalar quantization (ISQ), SSQ has the ability to exploit intercomponent correlation. At the same time, since quantization is performed on scalar rather than vector variables, SSQ offers a significant computational advantage over conventional VQ techniques and is easily amenable to a hardware implementation. In order to analyze the performance of SSQ, the authors appeal to asymptotic quantization theory, where the codebook size is assumed to be large. Closed-form expressions are derived for the quantizer mean squared error (MSE). These expressions are used to compare the asymptotic performance of SSQ with other VQ techniques. The authors also demonstrate the use of asymptotic theory in designing SSQ for a practical application (color image quantization), where the codebook size is typically small. Theoretical and experimental results show that SSQ far outperforms ISQ with respect to MSE while offering a considerable reduction in computation over conventional VQ at the expense of a moderate increase in MSE.<>","1941-0042","","10.1109/83.413172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=413172","","Iterative algorithms;Hardware;Performance analysis;Product codes;Distortion measurement;Vector quantization;Color;Data compression;Speech coding;Rate distortion theory","vector quantisation;image colour analysis;correlation methods;sequences;image coding","sequential scalar quantization;vector quantization;scalar components;intercomponent correlation;performance;asymptotic quantization theory;closed-form expressions;quantizer mean squared error;asymptotic performance;color image quantization;codebook size;computation","","22","2","20","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The individual transform coefficients are then scalar quantized with a non uniform bit assignment. Starting from the CMTT/2 proposal, the study presents a new video coding scheme designed using a vector quantizer solution instead of the scalar one. Specifically, the pyramid vector quantization (PVQ) has been chosen as the vector quantization method as it is able to reduce the DCT coefficients Laplacian distribution.

This paper develops analytical expressions for performance of high rate vector quantization (VQ) schemes which are trained by minimizing suboptimal distortion measures, and applies these results to the problem of quantizing the LPC parameters. In particular, the theory is developed to evaluate the performance, as measured by one distortion measure, of a vector quantizer which has been trained by minimizing a different distortion measure.

Under consecutive square entropy learning framework, the basic idea of entropy-guided learning technique is to measure the uncertainty of the input vectors used for QKLMS, and delete those data with larger uncertainty, which are insignificant or easy to cause learning errors. Then, the data set are compressed. Consequently, by using square entropy, the learning performance of proposed EQ-KLMS is improved with high precision and low computational cost.

This is natural for circularly symmetric densities such as IID Gaussian. A number of polar schemes have been proposed, analyzed and optimized. One of the best is unrestricted polar quantization (UPQ), in which the phase step size depends on the quantized magnitude. Prior analysis has shown that when optimized, its SNR is only 0.17 dB less than optimal 2-dimensional VQ. We show that UPQ can be very simply analyzed and optimized using the VQ version of Bennett's integral. Indeed, it is shown that one may optimize UPQ based solely on the criteria that it have the point density of an optimal VQ, and square rather than hexagonal cells. We also analyze and optimize power law polar quantization, in which the number of phase levels is proportional to a power of the quantized magnitude.","","0-7803-3956-8","10.1109/ISIT.1997.612975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=612975","","Quantization;Computer science;Density functional theory;Calculus","vector quantisation;optimisation;integral equations;Gaussian processes","SNR;vector quantization;quantized magnitude;circularly symmetric densities;IID Gaussian density;unrestricted polar quantization;phase step size;optimal 2D VQ;Bennett's integral;point density;square cells;power law polar quantization;phase levels","","16","4","7","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the GLA is dependent on the initial codebook. These drawbacks can lead to a perceptually poorly performing codebook. A heuristic algorithm is presented which compensates for the above deficiencies to render a high-quality codebook from the perceptual point of view. This algorithm has been developed for a special vector-quantization-based image coding method, the mean/quantized residual vector quantizer (MQRVQ) method. The parameters used for tuning the algorithm depend on the distortion measure and the image vector quantization method. Thus, it lacks the generality of the GLA. In the context of MQRVQ, the algorithm has resulted in a codebook which is very close to a local optimum while providing good perceptual quality for reconstructed images.

However, many radio-frequency (RF) chains will require high power consumption and lots of hardware cost. One of the practical solutions is using low-resolution discrete phase shifters (PSs) for each antenna and RF chain. This article designs a nonlinear quantized constant envelope precoding algorithm for MU-MIMO systems with low-resolution discrete PS at the base station. In this algorithm, the quantized constant envelope precoding problem is presented as a nonconvex optimization problem. The multiuser interference is minimized by solving the optimal precoded vector and the associated precoding factors. First, we consider relaxing the nonconvex constraint on the 1-bit quantized constant envelope precoding to a continuous set of convex constraints on the unit circle. Afterwards, the semidefinite relaxation method is used to tackle the equivalent 1-bit quantized precoding problem. We further extend the algorithm to provide multi-bit quantized constant envelop precoding. Finally, the simulations are carried out under various conditions and compared with the most advanced precoding methods. The results demonstrate that this algorithm achieves a comparable performance to the existing precoding methods. At the same time, the corresponding performance-complexity tradeoff is more conducive to the expansion of the proposed algorithm to the multibit case.;Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles <BR><BR>""An Efficient Nonlinear Quantized Constant Envelope Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO Systems,"" <BR>by R.

These product codes separate the mean and orientation information from each source vector and encode this information independently to allow the residual to be vector quantized more accurately. The color image coder also reduces the required bit rate by taking advantage of spectral redundancy.

While the precoding problem can be formulated using a standard maximum likelihood (ML) encoder, the implementation cost is prohibitive for massive numbers of antennas, even if a sphere encoding approach is used. Instead, we study the performance of a one-bit quantized zero-forcing precoder, and we show that it asymptotically provides the desired downlink vector with low complexity.

Using a technique similar in spirit to the mean removed VQ (MRVQ) of Baker and Gray (1983), significant reduction in the number of probability tables is achieved. In one of their simulations, they reduced the number of probability tables from 262 K(=2/sup 18/) to 108 by using the ITG algorithm, and from 108 to 10 using the modified MRVQ at the conditional entropy increase of only 1.26%.

It is known that when channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter a large performance gain can be achieved. In a system employing time-division duplexing (TDD), CSI can be obtained at the base station if there is reciprocity between the forward and reverse channels. CSI can also be conveyed from the users to the base station via a limited-rate feedback channel in a frequency-division duplexing (FDD) system. In any case, channel estimation errors are inevitable due to the presence of background noise in the estimated signal and due to the finite number of feedback bits used in a limited-rate feedback system model. In this paper, we first consider the general case when partial CSI is available at the transmitter. We derive an MMSE based precoding technique that considers channel estimation errors as an integral part of the system design. Using rate-distortion theory and the generalized Lloyd vector quantization algorithm, we then specialize our results for the more practical limited-rate feedback system model. Compared to previously proposed precoding techniques such as channel inversion and regularized channel inversion, it is shown that the proposed precoding technique significantly improves the average bit error rate (BER) in the system. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed technique is investigated in the high signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) regime. It is shown that the proposed technique suffers from a ceiling effect that asymptotically limits the system performance.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4686268","MIMO broadcast channels;downlink precoding;channel inversion;regularized channel inversion","Antenna feeds;Downlink;Feedback;Base stations;Receiving antennas;Transmitters;Channel estimation;Bit error rate;Wireless communication;Channel state information","antenna arrays;channel coding;channel estimation;error statistics;feedback;least mean squares methods;multiuser channels;precoding;radio links;rate distortion theory;vector quantisation;wireless channels","multiple antenna MMSE based downlink precoding;quantized feedback;channel mismatch;multiuser wireless communication system;base station;channel state information;time-division duplexing;limited-rate feedback channel;frequency-division duplexing system;channel estimation error;background noise;rate-distortion theory;generalized Lloyd vector quantization algorithm;average bit error rate;minimum mean square error method","","103","5","43","","25 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed technique relies on the identification of invariants in the IA equations, which enables the reformulation of the CSI quantization problem as a single quantization on the Grassmann manifold at each receiver. The scaling of the number of feedback bits with the transmit power sufficient to preserve the multiplexing gain that can be achieved under perfect CSI is established. We show that the CSI feedback requirements of the proposed technique are better (lower) than what is required when using previously published methods (including state-of-the-art codebook-based as well as analog feedback techniques), for system dimensions (number of users and antennas) of practical interest. Furthermore, we show through simulations that this advantage persists at low SNR, in the sense that the proposed technique yields a higher sum-rate performance for a given number of feedback bits. Finally, to complement our analysis, we introduce a statistical model that faithfully captures the properties of the quantization error obtained for random vector quantization (RVQ) on the Grassmann manifold for large codebooks; this enables the numerical (Monte Carlo) analysis of general Grassmannian RVQ schemes for codebook sizes that would be impractically large to simulate.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2015.2490223","FP7 project HIATUS(grant numbers:#265578); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(grant numbers:NFN SISE (S106).); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298450","K-user MIMO interference channel;interference alignment;CSI quantization;Grassmann manifold;K-user MIMO interference channel;interference alignment;CSI quantization;Grassmann manifold","Receivers;Interference;Quantization (signal);Transmitters;MIMO;Manifolds;Signal to noise ratio","MIMO communication;multiplexing;radiofrequency interference;statistical analysis;vector quantisation","interference alignment;quantized Grassmannian feedback;k-user constant MIMO interference channel;channel state information feedback scheme;MIMO IC;multiple-input-multiple-output interference channel;IA equations;CSI quantization problem;Grassmann manifold;feedback bits;transmit power;multiplexing gain;statistical model;quantization error;random vector quantization;numerical analysis;general Grassmannian RVQ schemes;codebook sizes;low SNR;signal-to-noise ration","","12","","30","IEEE","14 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve robustness with respect to i.i.d. dropouts, the controller transmits data packets containing quantized plant input predictions. These are provided by an appropriate optimal entropy coded dithered lattice vector quantizer. Within this context, we derive stochastic stability results and provide a noise-shaping model of the closed loop system. This model is employed for performance analysis by using rate-distortion theory.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2139410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5742978","Networked control systems;packet drops;predictive control;rate-distortion;source coding;stability analysis;stochastic systems;vector quantization","Stability analysis;Source coding;Vector quantization;Stochastic systems;Predictive control;Networked control systems;Rate-distortion","closed loop systems;entropy;linear systems;networked control systems;predictive control;rate distortion theory;stability;stochastic systems;vector quantisation","packetized predictive control;stochastic systems;bit-rate limited channels;packet loss;linear time-invariant plants;random disturbances;distributed dropouts;dropout-rates;quantized plant input predictions;optimal entropy coded dithered lattice vector quantizer;stochastic stability;noise-shaping model;closed loop system;rate-distortion theory","","89","","66","IEEE","7 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While experienced doctors may locate the tumor regions in a US image manually, it is highly desirable to develop algorithms that automatically detect the tumor regions in order to assist medical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for automatic detection of breast tumors in US images. We formulate the tumor detection as a two step learning problem: tumor localization by bounding box and exact boundary delineation. Specifically, the proposed method uses an AdaBoost classifier on Harr-like features to detect a preliminary set of tumor regions. The preliminarily detected tumor regions are further screened with a support vector machine using quantized intensity features. Finally, the random walk segmentation algorithm is performed on the US image to retrieve the boundary of each detected tumor region. The proposed method has been evaluated on a data set containing 112 breast US images, including histologically confirmed 80 diseased ones and 32 normal ones. The data set contains one image from each patient and the patients are from 31 to 75 years old. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can automatically detect breast tumors, with their locations and boundary shapes retrieved with high accuracy.","1945-8452","978-1-4577-1858-8","10.1109/ISBI.2012.6235878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6235878","Ultrasound Image;Breast Tumor Detection;AdaBoost;Support Vector Machine;Random Walks","Image segmentation;Support vector machines;Breast tumors;Ultrasonic imaging;Feature extraction;Accuracy","biological tissues;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;object detection;support vector machines;tumours","automatic breast tumor detection;automatic breast tumor segmentation;ultrasound images;breast cancer;medical diagnosis;US images;two step learning problem;tumor localization;AdaBoost classifier;Harr-like features;support vector machine;quantized intensity features;random walk segmentation;boundary shapes;age 31 yr to 75 yr","","18","","11","","12 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our primary goal is to improve the power efficiency of the system in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while obtaining achievable BER in underwater communication. In underwater communication, inter-symbol-interference and acoustic interference are the two most important issues, which affect the system performance. We use spread spectrum technique to mitigate the effects of unwanted information in the presence of ambient noise. Multi-user transmitter pre-processing (MUTP) is the digital processing method, which is carried out at the transmitter side to offer the low complexity of the receiver. We formulate the singular value decomposition-based pre-processing matrix using noisy feedback of vector quantized (VQ) estimated channel information (CI). We consider the MC communication to mitigate the effects of multi-path propagations. We realize iterative style of decoding algorithm at the receiver to retrieve the acoustic information from the ambient noise contaminated acoustic signals. In particular, we evaluate the error-rate analysis of MC system for realistic channel model based on shallow water channel model, which consists of 11 tap delay. Simulation results emanating from this paper bring to surface the considered coded MC system with MUTP offering a better BER performance with power efficiency regarding SNR while retaining the low complexity of the receiver.

This design problem is an NP-hard binary quadratic programming due to the one-bit constraints on the elements of the precoder’s output vector, and hence, is difficult to solve. In this paper, we tackle this difficulty by reformulating the problem, in several steps, into an equivalent continuous-domain biconvex form. Our final biconvex reformulation is obtained via an exact penalty approach and can efficiently be solved using a standard block coordinate ascent algorithm. We show through simulation results that the proposed design outperforms the existing schemes in terms of (uncoded) bit error rate.

The aim of this work is to facilitate design space exploration by providing more accurate resource estimates before running time consuming processes such as High Level Synthesis (HLS) or logic synthesis. We integrated the algorithms in FINN, an end-to-end framework for building Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) FPGA inference accelerators, in order to evaluate and compare them to existing estimation as well as the actual synthesized design. We generated Support Vector Regression (SVR) models for LUT and BRAM estimation, the former yields promising results, while the latter consistently underperforms in comparison to HLS and analytical FINN estimates. Combining the analytical approach used in FINN with SVR LUT estimation provided more accurate results because on its own, SVR had insufficient extrapolation capability.

The framework of the quantization problem is sufficiently general to include quantization schemes with general non-mean square distortion functions, and constrained source vectors. The result of the asymptotic distortion analysis of the proposed general quantization problem is presented, which extends the vector version of Bennett's integral.

At present, many large transnational e-commerce platforms are committed to scientific commodity evaluation trend prediction, so as to timely understand the popularity of commodities based on the existing data, so as to maximize their own interests. Amazon’s platform provides consumers with product ratings and text-based reviews. We collected the recent evaluation data of the three commodities on the platform, and put forward reasonable analysis and prediction. Firstly, the text-based evaluation and commodity rating are processed quantitatively to form a two-dimensional evaluation vector, and the part that is inconsistent with the evaluation emotion is eliminated to realize data cleaning.

In order to control the quantization errors in the frequency domain, adaptively weighted matching is employed instead of the conventional adaptive bit allocation. Therefore, the residual signal can be reconstructed by the decoder, even if the spectral envelope parameters are destroyed due to transmission errors.

When A is large and i.i.d. Gaussian, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is an efficient means of MAP or marginal inference, and its performance can be rigorously characterized by a scalar state evolution. For general A, though, GAMP can misbehave. Damping and sequential-updating help to robustify GAMP, but their effects are limited. Recently, a “vector AMP” (VAMP) algorithm was proposed for additive white Gaussian noise channels. VAMP extends AMP's guarantees from i.i.d.

For audio-file ranking and retrieval from text queries, based on stabilized auditory images, we took a multi-scale approach, using vector quantization to choose one sparse feature in each of many overlapping regions of different scales, with the hope that in some regions the features for a sound would be stable even when other interfering sounds were present and affecting other regions. We recently extended our testing of this approach using sound mixtures, and found that the sparse-coded auditory-image features degrade less in interference than vector-quantized MFCC sparse features do. This initial success suggests that our hope of robustness in interference may indeed be realizable, via the general idea of sparse features that are localized in a domain where signal components tend to be localized or stable.","2379-190X","978-1-4577-0539-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5947698","Auditory image;sparse code;PAMIR;sound retrieval and ranking","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Encoding;Vector quantization;Interference;Training;Sparse matrices;Testing","feature extraction;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);vector quantisation","sparse coding;machine hearing;machine learning system;PAMIR;passive-aggressive model for image retrieval;audio file ranking;vector quantization;sound mixture;sparse coded auditory image feature;feature extraction","","4","","9","","11 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The wavelet transform is used to obtain a set of different frequency subbands of the image; the image is decomposed using a pyramidal algorithm architecture.

The use of wavelets and multiresolution analysis is becoming increasingly popular for image compression. We examine several different approaches to the quantization of wavelet coefficients. A standard approach in subband coding is to use DPCM to encode the lowest band while the higher bands are quantized using a scalar quantizer for each band or a vector quantizer. We implement these schemes using a variety of quantizer including PDF optimized quantizers and recursively indexed scalar quantizers (RISQ). We then incorporate a threshold operation to prevent the removal of perceptually important information. We show that there is a both subjective and objective improvements in performance when we use the RISQ and the perceptual thresholds. The objective performance measure shows a consistent two to three dB improvement over a wide range of rates. Finally we use a recursively indexed vector quantizer (RIVQ) to encode the wavelet coefficients. The RIVQ can operate at relatively high rates and is therefore particularly suited for quantizing the coefficients in the lowest band.","1068-0314","0-8186-7012-6","10.1109/DCC.1995.515593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=515593","","Wavelet coefficients;Image coding;NASA;Wavelet analysis;Multiresolution analysis;Vector quantization","image coding;image resolution;recursive estimation;vector quantisation;differential pulse code modulation;probability;wavelet transforms","wavelet coefficients;image compression;multiresolution analysis;subband coding;DPCM;PDF optimized quantizers;recursively indexed scalar quantizers;threshold operation;perceptually important information;performance improvements;perceptual thresholds;objective performance measure;recursively indexed vector quantizer","","","2","2","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The important issue is that presented algorithms exploit mutual correlation between vector quantized chrominance and the luminance component of video data. In transform coding techniques, the activity of reconstructed luminance estimated for its transform coefficients controls quantization steps of respective transform coefficients of scalar chrominance.

In the low bit-resolution image generation, adaptive quantization is employed to reduce the bit resolution of the pixel values, which is better than simple truncation of the least significant bits in preserving the dynamic range of the pixel values. The proposed algorithm consists of two search steps: in the low-resolution search, a set of candidate motion vectors is determined, and in the full-resolution search, the motion vector is found from these candidate motion vectors. The hardware cost of the proposed algorithm is 1/17 times of the full search algorithm, while its peak signal-to-noise ratio is better than that of the 4:1 alternate subsampling for the search range of /spl plusmn/32/spl times//spl plusmn/32. A VLSI architecture of the proposed algorithm is also described, which can concurrently perform two prediction modes of the MPEG2 video standard with the search range of (-32.0,-32.0)-(+31.5,+31.5).

Each element of this codevector is an address of an entry in the LBG-codebook, representing a vector quantized block. The address-codebook consists of two regions: one is the active (addressable) region, and the other is the inactive (nonaddressable) region. During the encoding process the codevectors in the address-codebook are reordered adaptively in order to bring the most probable address-codevectors into the active region. When encoding an address-codevector, the active region of the address-codebook is checked, and if such an address combination exist its index is transmitted to the receiver. Otherwise, the address of each block is transmitted individually.

The framework of the quantization problem is sufficiently general to include quantization schemes with general non-mean-squared distortion functions and constrained source vectors. Asymptotic distortion analysis of the proposed general quantization problem is provided by extending the vector version of the Bennett's integral. Specifically, tight lower and upper bounds of the average asymptotic distortion are proposed. Sufficient conditions for the achievability of the distortion bounds are also provided and related to corresponding classical fixed-rate quantization problems. The proposed general methodology provides a powerful analytical tool to study a wide range of finite-rate feedback systems.

Therefore, it is desired to design a method which can early detect zero quantized DCT coefficients (ZQDCT) before implementing DCT and quantization (Q) and thus reduce redundant computations for H.264 coding. To achieve this, a hybrid model is proposed in this paper in order to predict ZQDCT coefficients. First, the Gaussian distribution is applied to study the integer DCT coefficients in H.264 and hence an adaptive scheme with multiple thresholds is derived to realize different types of DCT and Q implementations. Then the adaptive scheme is further optimized by considering a more efficient condition to sufficiently detect all-zero DCT blocks. As a result, a hybrid model is developed. Compared with other methods in the literature, the proposed hybrid model is able to detect more ZQDCT coefficients and hence reduce more computations for H.264 encoding. It is shown by experimental results that the proposed hybrid model can achieve the best performance in reducing computations and obtain almost the same rate-distortion (R-D) performance as the original encoder in the H.264 reference software JM9.5","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2007.893336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4202608","Gaussian distribution;H.264;integer DCT;quantization","Discrete cosine transforms;Encoding;Video coding;Quantization;Computational complexity;Design methodology;Predictive models;Gaussian distribution;Rate-distortion;Software performance","discrete cosine transforms;Gaussian distribution;quantisation (signal);vector quantisation;video coding","H.264 coding;discrete cosine transform;zero quantized DCT coefficient detection;Gaussian distribution","","44","","24","","21 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To characterize the signal reconstruction quality in this framework, most of the existing theoretical analyses lie heavily on the quantization of sub-Gaussian random projections (e.g., Gaussian or Bernoulli). We show here that a simple uniform scalar quantizer is compatible with a large class of random sensing matrices known to respect, with high probability, the restricted isometry property (RIP). Critically, this compatibility arises from the addition of a uniform random vector, or dithering, to the linear signal observations before quantization. In this setting, we prove the existence of (at least) one signal reconstruction method, i.e., the projected back projection (PBP), whose reconstruction error decays when the number of quantized measurements increases. This holds with high probability in the estimation of sparse signals and low-rank matrices. We validate numerically the predicted error decay as the number of measurements increases.","","978-1-5386-1571-3","10.1109/SSP.2018.8450784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8450784","Quantized compressive sensing;scalar uniform quantization;uniform dithering;projected back projection","Sensors;Quantization (signal);Sparse matrices;Estimation;Compressed sensing;Nonlinear distortion","compressed sensing;Gaussian processes;matrix algebra;probability;quantisation (signal);signal reconstruction;vectors","restricted isometry property;uniform random vector;linear signal observations;projected back projection;sparse signals;dithered compressive sensing;quantized compressive sensing;compressive signal measurements;finite precision representation;signal reconstruction quality;sub-Gaussian random projections;simple uniform scalar quantizer;random sensing matrices;QCS;high probability;PBP;RIP","","","","30","","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An attractive feature of this method is that source encoding using the resultant codebook involves very few searches and its computational complexity is minimal and independent of the rate of the system. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is bit scalable and can switch seamlessly between a memoryless quantizer and a quantizer with memory. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated for speech coding where Gaussian mixture models are used to model speech line spectral frequencies. The performance of the memoryless quantizer is 1-3 bits better than conventional quantization schemes.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.809192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193579","","Vector quantization;Frequency;Switches;Speech coding;Probability density function;Parameter estimation;Transform coding;Bit rate;Encoding;Computational complexity","vector quantisation;speech coding;transform coding;source coding;optimisation;probability;Gaussian processes;computational complexity;spectral analysis","PDF optimized parametric vector quantization;PDF optimized parametric VQ;speech line spectral frequencies;computationally efficient VQ;high quality VQ;probability density function;i.i.d. observations;multivariate Gaussian mixture density;mixture model parameters;expectation maximization algorithm;EM algorithm;low complexity quantization;transform coding;bit allocation;variable rate systems;fixed rate systems;source encoding;codebook;computational complexity;bit scalable scheme;memoryless quantizer;memory quantizer;speech coding;Gaussian mixture models","","99","3","43","","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study made regional predictions based on sequences of daily rainfall maps of the continental US, with rainfall quantized at 3 levels: light or no rain; moderate; and heavy rain. Three regions were selected, corresponding to three squares from a 5×5 grid covering the map area. Rainfall predictions up to 30 days ahead for these three regions were based on a support vector machine (SVM) applied to consecutive sequences of prior daily rainfall map images. The results show that predictions for corner squares in the grid were less accurate than predictions obtained by a simple untrained classifier. However, SVM predictions for a central region outperformed the other two regions, as well as the untrained classifier. We conclude that there is some evidence that SVMs applied to large-scale precipitation maps can under some conditions give useful information for predicting regional rainfall, but care must be taken to avoid pitfalls.","","978-0-578-64709-8","10.23919/FUSION45008.2020.9190285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9190285","a comparison study;a sequence of images;SVMs","Rain;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Machine learning;Numerical models;Training;Testing","geophysical image processing;image classification;rain;support vector machines","social impacts;economic impacts;class-based approach;regional predictions;daily rainfall maps;map area;SVM predictions;central region;large-scale precipitation maps;regional rainfall prediction;support vector machine classification;rainfall map images;continental US","","2","","34","","10 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The empirical evaluation illustrates that, with the same amount of memory, PQMM outperforms the state-of-the-art sketch-based method with respect to the error.

A codebook must consist of a set of representative codewords. Hence, how to construct a significant codebook is the primary challenge in designing a VQ mechanism.

In the proposed coding scheme the still image is subdivided into circular partially overlapped regions and, then, some projections along predefined directions are determined and vector quantized by using geometrical VQ. The utilization of overlapped circular regions exploits the spatial redundancy present on the image, as the block subdivision does, and at the same time, it avoids the problem of blocking artifacts.

Recent information-theoretic results, obtained under ideal channel conditions (perfect synchronization, no dispersion), indicate that low-precision ADC (1-4 bits) could be a suitable choice for designing such high speed systems. In this work, we study the impact of employing low-precision ADC in a carrier asynchronous system. Specifically, we consider transmission over the block noncoherent additive white Gaussian noise channel, and investigate the achievable performance under low-precision output quantization. We focus attention on an architecture in which the receiver quantizes only the phase of the received signal: this has the advantage of being implementable without automatic gain control, using multiple 1-bit ADCs preceded by analog multipliers. For standard uniform Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation, we study the structure of the transition density of the phase-quantized block noncoherent channel. Several results, based on the symmetry inherent in the channel model, are provided to characterize this transition density. Low-complexity procedures for computing the channel information rate, and for block demodulation, are obtained using these results. Numerical computations are performed to compare the performance of quantized and unquantized systems, for different quantization precisions, and different block lengths. With QPSK modulation, it is observed, for example, that for SNR larger than 2-3 dB, 8-bin phase quantization of the received signal recovers about 80-85% of the mutual information attained with unquantized observations, while 12-bin phase quantization recovers more than 90% of the unquantized mutual information.

A sector bound approach is firstly introduced to handle the quantization error. Then the dynamics of estimation errors are modeled as a system with uncertainties. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a sufficient condition is derived such that the estimation error system is asymptotically stable and achieves a prescribed H∞ noise attenuation performance. A convex optimization problem is formulated for designing the desired distributed estimators. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.","","978-1-4799-4100-1","10.1109/ICInfA.2014.6932788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6932788","Distributed fault estimation;Networked systems;Channel resource limitation;Signal quantization","Estimation error;Quantization (signal);Design methodology;Linear matrix inequalities;Vectors;Bandwidth","asymptotic stability;control system synthesis;distributed control;fault tolerant control;H∞ control;Lyapunov methods;networked control systems;quantisation (signal)","distributed fault estimation;networked systems;quantized measurements;bandwidth resource;sector bound approach;quantization error;Lyapunov stability theory;sufficient condition;asymptotic stability;H∞ noise attenuation performance","","3","","19","","23 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, a group of mobile stations (MSs) acting as relays is chosen to assist a destination mobile station (DMS) in order to improve the communication reliability. In a cooperative DL communication, multi-user interference (MUI) at the relays proscribes the achievement of the relay diversity. Hence, in this correspondence, the DL MUI at the relays is suppressed with the aid of the transmitter preprocessing (TP) operated at the base station (BS). Further, the inter-relay interference (IRI) at the DMS is suppressed with the aid of the preprocessing operated at the relays. The preprocessing operated at the BS is based on constructing a subspace that is orthogonal to the interfering subspace, while that operated at the relays relies on the transmit minimum mean square error approach. Furthermore, the channel impulse responses (CIRs) required for concocting the TP is based on the quantized feedback more than ever at the BS while at the relays rely on perfect CIRs. Our study shows that TP assists in achieving the diversity gain by efficiently removing the DL MUI and IRI at the relays and the DMSs, respectively under perfect CIRs assumption at the transmitter. Also, it is inferred that the resultant BER performance of the quantized CIRs feedback based TP at the BS combined with perfect CIRs based TP at the relays remains close to that attained with the perfect CIRs knowledge.","","978-1-4799-3358-7","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950139","MC-CDMA;transmitter preprocessing;relay diversity;multi-user interference","Relays;Reliability;Multicarrier code division multiple access;Transmitting antennas;Modulation;Vectors","code division multiple access;cooperative communication;feedback;interference (signal);mean square error methods;mobile communication;radio links;radio transmitters;radiofrequency interference;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication network reliability;transient response","channel impulse responses;quantized CIR feedback;transmitter preprocessing;TP;bit-error-rate performance;BER performance;cooperative downlink;DL multicarrier code division multiple access system;relay-assisted MC-CDMA downlink system;destination mobile station;DMS;communication reliability;DL communication;multiuser interference;DL MUI;relay diversity;base station;interrelay interference;IRI;interfering subspace;transmit minimum mean square error approach","","","","18","","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method first combines holistic and local distance-based features so that facial expressions could be characterized in more detail. The combined distance-based features are subsequently quantized to form mid-level features using the bag of words approach. The synergistic effect of these steps leads to much improved class separability and thus we can use a typical method, e.g., Support Vector Machine (SVM), to perform classification.

For synthesizing high quality speech, accurate representation of the voiced portions of speech is essential. For bit rates of 4 kb/s and below, conventional code excited linear prediction (CELP) may likely not provide the appropriate degree of periodicity. It has been shown that good quality low bit rate speech coding can be obtained by frequency domain techniques such as sinusoidal transform coding (STC), multi-band excitation (MBE), mixed excitation linear prediction (MELP), and multi-band LPC (MB-LPC) vocoders. In this paper, a speech coding algorithm based on an improved version of MB-LPC is presented. Main features of this algorithm include a multi-stage time/frequency pitch estimation and an improved mixed voicing representation. An efficient quantization scheme for the spectral amplitudes of the excitation, called formant weighted vector quantization, is also used. This improved coder, called mixed sinusoidally excited linear prediction (MSELP), yields an unquantized model with speech quality better than the 32 kb/s AD-PCM quality.

The weight coefficients of the LIC should be sparse in order to predict and to encode frames effectively. Sparse representation aims at obtaining the least possible number of non-zero coefficients and is a powerful solution for the LIC. Our previous work has proposed the LIC using sparse representation and has achieved high prediction accuracy. Video coding standards encode motion vectors and prediction errors of the macro blocks independently. The prediction errors are converted via DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), and the quantized DCT coefficients are encoded. This means that the video coding standards predicts the current block using two steps, namely motion compensation and the DCT. Sparse representation is applied to optional basis vectors as reference blocks; thus, this study proposes a framework to conduct motion compensation and the DCT simultaneously by adding the DCT basis vectors into the sparse dictionary. Additionally, this study employs macro blocks generated using intra prediction because the intra prediction is also applied to the current block by neighbouring macro blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method integrating the two steps shows high prediction accuracy.","","978-6-1636-1823-8","10.1109/APSIPA.2014.7041737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7041737","","Discrete cosine transforms;Vectors;Motion compensation;Accuracy;Dictionaries;Video coding;Acceleration","discrete cosine transforms;image representation;motion compensation;video coding","local intensity compensation;sparse representation;sparse dictionary;novel motion compensation;linear combination;reference blocks;LIC;video coding standards;motion vectors;prediction errors;quantized DCT coefficients;discrete cosine transform;intra prediction;neighbouring macro blocks","","","","7","","16 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate that embedding the features is equivalent to using the SVM kernel trick with a mapping to a lower dimensional space. Furthermore, we show that universal embeddings-a recently proposed quantized embedding design-approximate a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, commonly used for kernel-based inference.

This paper proposes a limited feedback architecture that combines beamforming vector quantization and smart vector interpolation. In the proposed system, the receiver sends a fraction of information about the optimal beamforming vectors to the transmitter and the transmitter computes the beamforming vectors for all subcarriers through interpolation. A new spherical interpolator is developed that exploits parameters for phase rotation to satisfy the phase invariance and unit norm properties of the transmitted beamforming vectors. The beamforming vectors and phase parameters are quantized at the receiver and the quantized information is provided to the transmitter. The proposed quantization system provides only a moderate increase in complexity versus over comparable approaches.

Firstly, the quantized DCT coefficients with same frequency are extracted to build the new data matrices. Then, considering the direction effect on the correlation between the adjacent positions in DCT domain, twelve kinds of high-pass filter templates with different directions are executed and the translation probability matrix is calculated for each filtered data.

To synthesize a word, SEMG signals recorded during pronouncing a word are blocked into frames; SEMG features are then extracted from each SEMG frame and presented to the neural network to obtain a sequence of speech feature indices. The waveform of the word is then constructed by concatenating the pre-recorded speech segments corresponding to the feature indices. Experimental evaluations based on the synthesis of eight words show that on average over 70% of the words can be synthesized correctly and the neural network can classify SEMG frames into seven phonemes and silence at a rate of 77.8%.

"Adaptive image quantization based on learning classifier systems","Jianhua Lin","Computer Science Division, Eastern Connecticut State University, Willimantic, CT, USA","Proceedings DCC '95 Data Compression Conference","6 Aug 2002","1995","","","477","","Summary form only given. The performance of a quantizer depends primarily on the selection of a codebook. Most of the quantization techniques used in the past are based on a static codebook which stays unchanged for the entire input. As already demonstrated successfully in lossless data compression, adaptation can be very beneficial in the compression of typically changing input data. Adaptive quantization has been difficult to accomplish because of its lossy nature. We present a model for distribution-free adaptive image quantization based on learning classifier systems which have been used successfully in machine learning. A basic learning classifier system is a special type of message-processing, rule-based system that produces output according to its input environment. Probabilistic learning mechanisms are used to dynamically direct the behavior of the system to adapt to its environment. The adaptiveness of a learning classifier system seems very appropriate for the quantization problem. A learning classifier system based adaptive quantizer consists of the input data, a codebook, and the output. When an input can not be matched, a new codebook entry is constructed to match the input. Such an algorithm allows us not only to deal with the changing environment, but also to control the quality of the quantized output. The adaptive quantizers presented can be applied to both scalar quantization and vector quantization. Experimental results for each case in image quantization are very promising.","1068-0314","0-8186-7012-6","10.1109/DCC.1995.515587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=515587","","Quantization;Machine learning;Computer science;Computed tomography;Electronic mail;Data compression;Image coding;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems;Adaptive systems","adaptive signal processing;vector quantisation;image coding;learning systems;image classification;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","adaptive image quantization;learning classifier systems;codebook;quantization techniques;lossless data compression;distribution-free adaptive image quantization;machine learning;probabilistic learning mechanisms;message-processing rule-based system;input data;quantized output quality control;scalar quantization;vector quantization;experimental results","","1","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In limited feedback design over the channels, the discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM) is used as a fitting parametric model for capturing the time-variation of the multiuser downlink channels and for reducing the number of the channel parameters. The resulting dimension reduction in the channel representation, in turn, translates into a reduced feedback load of channel state information (CSI) to the base station (BS). To exploit the considerable reduction in CSI feedback load, vector quantization (VQ) of the DPS-BEM coefficients is performed at users under the assumption that perfect BEM coefficient estimation has been established by existing algorithms. The output indices of the quantized BEM coefficient vectors are assumed to be sent to the BS via error-free, zero-latency feedback links. With the quantized CSI, the block-diagonalization (BD) precoding and greedy scheduling techniques are employed for the heterogeneous multiuser transmission (i.e., users with different numbers of receive antennas and different signal-to-noise ratios). Numerical results show that the BEM-based limited feedback scheme is able to significantly alleviate the detrimental effect of outdated CSI feedback over the time-varying channels.","","978-1-4244-5247-7","10.1109/ICTEL.2010.5478876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478876","Limited feedback;greedy scheduling;block diagonalization precoding;vector quantization;discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM);time- and frequency-selective channels;heterogeneous multiuser network","MIMO;Downlink;Frequency;Parametric statistics;State feedback;Channel state information;Base stations;Vector quantization;Output feedback;Receiving antennas","feedback;MIMO communication;multiuser channels;scheduling;vector quantisation","heterogeneous multiuser transmission;BEM-based limited feedback design;doubly selective MIMO downlink channels;discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model;dimension reduction;channel representation;channel state information;base station;CSI feedback load;vector quantization;DPS-BEM coefficients;zero-latency feedback links;block-diagonalization precoding;greedy scheduling techniques","","1","2","15","","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system model is subjected to unknown functions, unknown delays, and unknown Bouc–Wen hysteresis nonlinearity. The coexistence of quantized input and actuator hysteresis may deteriorate the shape of hysteresis loop and, consequently, fail to guarantee the stability. To deal with this issue, a new FCSHQ is introduced to smooth the input hysteresis. This adaptive filter also provides us a degree of freedom at choosing the desired communication rate. The repetitive differentiations of virtual control laws and existing a lot of learning parameters in the neural network (NN)-based controller may result in an algebraic loop problem and high computational time, especially in a nonstrict-feedback form. This challenge is eased by the key advantage of NNs’ property where the upper bound of the weight vector is employed. Then, by an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, a common Lyapunov function is presented for all subsystems. It is shown that the proposed controller ensures the predefined output tracking accuracies and boundedness of the closed-loop signals under any arbitrary switching.

Only those authorized can recover the hidden data from the host, even after the latter has undergone standard transformations such as compression. We adopt a quantitative source and channel coding approach to hiding large amounts of compressible signature data inside the raw host. The signature data is source coded by vector quantization, and the indices are embedded in the host by perturbing it using orthogonal transform domain vector perturbations. The transform coefficients of the parent data are grouped into vectors, and the vectors are perturbed using noise-resilient channel codes derived from multidimensional lattices. The perturbations are constrained by a maximum allowable mean-squared error that can be introduced in the host. The generic approach is readily adapted to make retrieval possible even for applications where the original host is not available to the retriever. This scheme is applied to hiding speech in video. The host video is wavelet transformed frame by frame, and vectors of coefficients are perturbed using lattice channel codes to represent hidden vector quantized speech. The embedded video is subjected to H.263 compression before retrieving the hidden speech from it. The retrieved speech is intelligible even with large compression ratios of the host video.","","0-8186-8821-1","10.1109/ICIP.1998.723494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=723494","","Channel coding;Data encapsulation;Speech coding;Video compression;Watermarking;Lattices;Application software;Multidimensional systems;Data security;Copyright protection","data encapsulation;multimedia communication;channel coding;source coding;speech coding;vector quantisation;transform coding;wavelet transforms;video coding;security of data;copyright;mean square error methods","channel coding;source coding;data hiding;multimedia services;signature data;host data source;data compression;vector quantization;orthogonal transform domain vector perturbations;transform coefficients;noise-resilient channel codes;multidimensional lattices;maximum allowable mean-squared error;lattice channel codes;hidden vector quantized speech;embedded video;H.263 compression;VQ;data security;copyright protection;digital watermarking","","6","6","13","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a learning phase, the desired model parameters are then extracted from this sketch by solving an optimization problem, which also involves a feature map. When the feature map is identical during the sketching and learning phases, formal statistical guarantees (excess risk bounds) have been proven. However, the desirable properties of the feature map are different during sketching and learning (e.g., quantized outputs, and differentiability, respectively). We thus study the relaxation where this map is allowed to be different for each phase. First, we prove that the existing guarantees carry over to this asymmetric scheme, up to a controlled error term, provided some Limited Projected Distortion (LPD) property holds. We then instantiate this framework to the setting of quantized sketches, by proving that the LPD indeed holds for binary sketch contributions.

In our case, each transmitter's beamforming strategy is represented by a linear combining factor between the maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and the zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming vectors, which is shown to be a Pareto optimal achieving strategy. With the perfect CSI, each transmitter can know the exact achievable rate region, and hence can find the beamforming strategy corresponding to any point in the achievable rate region. With limited feedback, however, the transmitters can only conjecture the achievable rate region from the quantized CSI, so their optimal strategies may not be optimal anymore. Considering the quantized CSI at the transmitter, we first find the Nash equilibrium in a non-cooperative game. Then, in a cooperative (Nash bargaining) game, we find a Nash bargaining solution and test its validity. Finally, we propose three bargaining solutions that improve the validity of the cooperation or the average Nash product. Our proposed bargaining solutions utilize the codebook structure; instead of each quantized channel itself, its Voronoi region is considered.","","978-1-4799-5952-5","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417263","","Transmitters;Array signal processing;Games;Receivers;Channel estimation;Wireless communication;Quantization (signal)","array signal processing;game theory;MIMO communication;Pareto optimisation;radio transmitters;radiofrequency interference;wireless channels","beamforming game;CSI quantization;two-user MIMO interference channel;two-user multiple-input single-output interference channel;transmitter;channel state information;maximum-ratio transmission;MRT;zero-forcing beamforming vector;ZF beamforming vector;Pareto optimal achieving strategy;Nash bargaining equilibrium;Voronoi region","","","","13","","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The channel feedback scheme is based on zero-forcing block diagonalization (BD) and it is proposed for two distinct design cases; in case I, the number of streams intended for a user equals the number of antennas at that user; in case II, the number of streams is less than the number of receive antennas. Case I is applicable in scenarios where high data rate requirements are needed as it transmits data symbols over all of the available degrees of freedom of the system. Diversely, case II is applicable when reliability is a priority in the system as it uses the additional <italic>receive</italic> antennas at the user to achieve spatial diversity to enhance the link performance. The proposed scheme is analyzed for the two cases by quantifying the downlink rate gap from the case of perfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we design structured feedback codebooks based on optimal subspace packing in the Grassmannian manifold and show that these codes achieve close performance to the perfect CSI case. Additionally, a vector quantization scheme is proposed to quantize the user’s channel matrix when optimal power allocation across multiple streams is adopted in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. The feedback codebooks are based on optimal line packing in the Grassmannian manifold, where every vector of the user’s channel matrix is quantized and sent to the BaseStation. The results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between vector quantization, with power optimization across the data streams, and subspace quantization. Specifically, vector quantization codebooks outperform subspace-based codebooks in the low SNR region, while the situation is reversed in the high SNR region.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3140418","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie(grant numbers:812991); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669271","Massive MIMO;FDD;multiple antenna users;block diagonalization;singular values and singular vectors;channel feedback;subspace codebooks;water-filling","Downlink;Channel estimation;Signal to noise ratio;Receiving antennas;Massive MIMO;Antenna feeds;Vector quantization","antenna arrays;channel estimation;frequency division multiplexing;MIMO communication;receiving antennas;vector quantisation;wireless channels","AoD-adaptive channel feedback;FDD massive MIMO systems;multiple-antenna users;efficient feedback scheme;departure based channel estimation;frequency division duplex massive multiple-input multiple-output systems;multiple antennas;channel feedback scheme;distinct design cases;high data rate requirements;receive antennas;downlink rate gap;perfect channel state information;feedback codebooks;optimal subspace packing;perfect CSI case;vector quantization scheme;channel matrix;multiple streams;data streams;outperform subspace-based codebooks","","","","43","CCBY","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, unlike previous approaches, we quantize the channels using mean squared inner product (MSIP) vector quantization (VQ) and derive an SMSE-based algorithm that considers MSIP quantization error as an integral component of the whole system. This decreases the bit error rate (BER) at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and outperforms previously derived MU MISO linear transceivers that exist in the limited feedback literature.

Although BMP can outperform the other existing methods as Quantized Compressive Sampling Matched Pursuit (QCoSaMP) and Quantized Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (QISTA), its accuracy is still far from the optimal, yielding a locally optimal solution. Motivated by this, we propose an advanced greedy algorithm by leveraging the idea of a stack algorithm, which is referred to as stacked BMP (StBMP). The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to store a number of candidate partial paths (i.e., the candidate support sets) in an ordered stack and tries to find the global optimal solution by searching along the best path in the stack.

The key idea of the gradient compression strategy is to compress-and-quantize a local gradient vector computed at each device after sparsifying this vector in a block wise fashion. Our gradient compression strategy can make communication overhead less than one bit per gradient entry. For accurate reconstruction of the local gradient from the compressed signals at the PS, we employ a expectation-maximization generalized-approximate-message-passing algorithm. The algorithm iteratively computes an approximate minimum mean square error solution of the local gradient, while learning the unknown model parameters of the Bernoulli Gaussian-mixture prior.

In this paper, we propose three OIA techniques: antenna selection-based OIA, singular value decomposition (SVD)-based OIA, and vector-quantized (codebook-based) OIA. Then, their performance is analyzed in terms of user scaling law required to achieve KS degrees-of-freedom (DoF), where S(≤ M) denotes the number of simultaneously transmitting MSs per cell. As our main result, it is shown that the antenna selection-based OIA does not fundamentally change the user scaling required to achieve KS DoF if L is fixed, compared with the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) IMAC case. In contrast, it is shown that the SVD-based OIA can greatly reduce the required user scaling to SNR(K-1) S-L+1 through optimizing weight vectors at each MS. Furthermore, we show that the vector-quantized OIA can achieve the same user scaling as the SVD-based OIA case if the codebook size is beyond a certain value.

In particular, we consider the setting where information about the system state is obtained using noisy sensor measurements. This data is quantized and transmitted to a (possibly untrustworthy) remote station through a public/unsecured communication network. We aim at keeping (part of) the state of the system private; however, because the network (and/or the remote station) might be unsecure, adversaries might have access to sensor data, which can be used to estimate the system state. To prevent such adversaries from obtaining an accurate state estimate, before transmission, we randomize quantized sensor data using additive random vectors, and send the corrupted data to the remote station instead.

For a Gaussian source scalar-quantized to 8 bit, multicarrier transmission yields a 13 dB improvement of signal-to-distortion ratio over a single-carrier system. Quantizers having a smaller number of bits yield smaller improvements. We consider both full-search and binary tree-search vector quantizers using a natural binary coding scheme. For a vector quantizer using 2 b/sample, multicarrier transmission yields an improvement in signal-to-distortion ratio that lies between 0.3 and 0.8 dB, depending on the quantizer design.","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.544460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=544460","","Modulation coding;Channel coding;Distortion;Transmitters;Bit error rate;Protection;Signal analysis;Signal design;Source coding;Additive noise","frequency division multiplexing;modulation;channel coding;source coding;vector quantisation;quantisation (signal);tree searching;telecommunication channels","analog signal transmission;multicarrier modulation;source-channel coding;subchannels modulation;subchannels power;quantized signal;channel induced distortion;analog sources;VQ;scalar quantizers;Gaussian source;multicarrier transmission;signal-to-distortion ratio;binary tree-search vector quantizers;full-search vector quantizers;binary coding;quantizer design;OFDM","","31","1","38","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is widely flexible in the number of quantization bits and offers an adaptive diversity technique that allows for transmission of multiple data streams on orthogonal beams, thereby substantially increasing the system capacity or providing a new radio link for a new service. The convergence speed is maximized by computing the optimal increment vector which points in the direction of largest directional derivative of the objective function. We show that the algorithm converges globally irrespective of quantization error: the quantized increment vector always provides positive directional derivative at any non-stationary point in the solution space containing no local maxima.

Conventional algorithms, such as the arithmetic mean, in the case of the estimation of a constant, are known not to be optimal in the presence of quantization errors. They provide biased estimates if particular conditions regarding the quantization process are not met, as it usually happens in practice. In this paper, a quantile-based estimator is presented, which is based on the Gauss-Markov theorem. The general theory is first described and the estimator is then applied to both direct current and alternate current input signals with unknown characteristics.

In a femtocell network, coordination among FAPs is possible exploiting the IP-based backhaul link. In particular, we consider the case where the exchange of information among FAPs is quantized and happens through a network graph (typically a sparse graph), whose links fail randomly across iterations. Using results from stochastic approximation theory, we propose a distributed projection based Robbins-Monro (RM) scheme that converges almost surely (a. s.) on a final allocation equilibrium dependent on the mean graph of the network, even in the presence of such imperfect communication scenario. Numerical results show how the system performance reduces due to the effect of link failures, which cause a lower coordination among FAPs to mitigate interference. Nevertheless, supposing to know the probability with which each link fails, we show how to counteract the effect of failures through a proper weighting of the price coefficients received by the neighbor FAPs. The distributed allocation algorithm is then robust to channel imperfections, whose effect is only to slow down the convergence process.","","978-1-4577-2105-2","10.1109/CAMSAP.2011.6135971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6135971","","Interference;Quantization;Pricing;Convergence;Femtocell networks;Noise;Vectors","approximation theory;distributed algorithms;femtocellular radio;graph theory;interference suppression;network theory (graphs);pricing;probability;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability","distributed stochastic pricing mechanism;sum-rate maximization;femtocellular networks;random graph;quantized communications;neighbor femto access points;IP-based backhaul link;network graph;stochastic approximation theory;distributed projection based Robbins-Monro scheme;link failure effect;channel imperfections;allocation equilibrium dependent;convergence process;distributed allocation algorithm;price coefficient weighting;interference mitigation","","4","","9","","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These metrics are included in the signal reconstruction process to enforce quantization consistency. Signal reconstruction is formulated as a linear program. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed numerically and compared with other signal recovery techniques.

Although the subsequent HDDHMM is fast in decoding, it is not accurate enough. In this paper, making use of the fact that, for a fixed number of bits, VQ is more efficient than SQ, subvector quantization (SVQ) was investigated to improve the quantization efficiency while keeping the (time and space) complexity of the quantizer sufficiently low. Model parameters of the resulting SVQ-HDDHMM were further re-estimated.

The first two schemes are direct extensions of previously proposed schemes to the OFDM case. The key difference with respect to the widely treated frequency-flat case is that in MIMO-OFDM the ldquofrequency-domainrdquo channel is a Gaussian correlated source.

Achievable bounds for different performance measures are derived. First, we analytically show that a simple feedback scheme based on relay selection can achieve full diversity. Unlike the previous diversity analysis on the relay selection scheme, our analysis is not aided by any approximations or modified forwarding schemes. Then, for highrate feedback, we find an upper bound on the average signalto- noise ratio (SNR) loss. Using this result, we demonstrate that both the average SNR loss and the capacity loss decay at least exponentially with the number of feedback bits. In addition, we provide approximate upper and lower bounds on the BER, which can be calculated numerically.We observe that our designs can achieve both full diversity as well as high array gain with only a moderate number of feedback bits. Simulations also show that our approximate BER is a reliable estimation on the actual BER.

A sparse signal recovery problem exploiting the sparse nature of mm-wave channels is formulated for channel estimation based on the parametric channel model with quantized angles of departures/arrivals (AoDs/AoAs), called the angle grids. The problem is solved by the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm employing a redundant dictionary consisting of array response vectors with finely quantized angle grids. We suggest the use of non-uniformly quantized angle grids and show that such grids reduce the coherence of the redundant dictionary. The lower and upper bounds of the sum-of-squared errors of the proposed OMP-based estimator are derived analytically: the lower bound is derived by considering the oracle estimator that assumes the knowledge of AoDs/AoAs, and the upper bound is derived based on the results of the OMP performance guarantees. The design of training vectors (or sensing matrix) is particularly important in hybrid MIMO systems, because the RF beamformer prevents the use of independent and identically distributed random training vectors, which are popular in compressed sensing. We design training vectors so that the total coherence of the equivalent sensing matrix is minimized for a given RF beamforming matrix, which is assumed to be unitary. It is observed that the estimation accuracy can be improved significantly by randomly permuting the columns of the RF beamforming matrix. The simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed OMP with a redundant dictionary over the existing methods such as the least squares method and the OMP based on the virtual channel model.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2557791","ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP [B0101-16-1369, Development of small basestation supporting multiple streams based on LTE-A systems]; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458188","Channel estimation;hybrid RF/baseband processing;millimeter wave communication;orthogonal matching pursuit;sparsity;Channel estimation;hybrid RF/baseband processing;millimeter wave communication;orthogonal matching pursuit;sparsity","Channel estimation;MIMO;Radio frequency;Matching pursuit algorithms;Training;Array signal processing;Estimation","antenna arrays;array signal processing;channel estimation;compressed sensing;direction-of-arrival estimation;iterative methods;matrix algebra;MIMO communication","orthogonal matching pursuit;hybrid MIMO systems;millimeter wave communications;open-loop channel estimator;mm-wave hybrid multiple-input multiple-output system;radio-frequency beamformers;antenna arrays;baseband MIMO processor;sparse signal recovery problem;mm-wave channels;parametric channel model;AoD-AoAs;OMP algorithm;redundant dictionary;array response vectors;nonuniformly quantized angle grids;redundant dictionary coherence reduction;sum-of-squared errors;upper bounds;lower bounds;independent-identically distributed random training vectors;compressed sensing;sensing matrix;RF beamforming matrix;virtual channel model;quantized angle of departure-arrival estimation","","275","4","41","IEEE","22 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The receiver for a particular user selects the signature from a signature codebook, and relays the corresponding B index bits to the transmitter over a noiseless channel. We study the performance of a random vector quantization (RVQ) scheme in which the codebook entries are independent and isotropically distributed. Assuming the interfering signatures are independent, and have independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) elements, we evaluate the received signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) in the large system limit as the number of users, processing gain, and feedback bits B all tend to infinity with fixed ratios. This SINR is evaluated for both the matched filter and linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receivers. Furthermore, we show that this large system SINR is the maximum that can be achieved over any sequence of codebooks. Numerical results show that with the MMSE receiver, one feedback bit per signature coefficient achieves close to single-user performance. We also consider a less complex and suboptimal reduced-rank signature optimization scheme in which the user's signature is constrained to lie in a lower dimensional subspace. The optimal subspace coefficients are scalar-quantized and relayed to the transmitter. The large system performance of the quantized reduced-rank scheme can be approximated, and numerical results show that it performs in the vicinity of the RVQ bound. Finally, we extend our analysis to the scenario in which a subset of users optimize their signatures in the presence of random interference.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2005.855583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512421","Asymptotics;code-division multiple access (CDMA);feedback;large system analysis;reduced-rank signature;signature optimization;vector quantization","Multiaccess communication;Feedback;Signal to noise ratio;Relays;Transmitters;Direct-sequence code-division multiple access;Vector quantization;Signal processing;H infinity control;Matched filters","code division multiple access;spread spectrum communication;radio receivers;radio transmitters;vector quantisation;matched filters;least mean squares methods;optimisation;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication channels;AWGN","joint signature-receiver optimization;direct-sequence code-division multiple access;DS-CDMA;noiseless channel;random vector quantization;RVQ scheme;matched filter;linear minimum mean-squared error;MMSE receivers;reduced-rank signature optimization scheme;random interference","","80","3","45","","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we consider that all the quantized measurements are available at a central fusion center. We derive performance bounds for sparsity pattern recovery using 1-bit quantized measurements from multiple sensors when the maximum likelihood decoder is employed. We further develop two computationally tractable algorithms for joint sparse support recovery in the centralized setting. One algorithm minimizes a cost function defined as the sum of the likelihood function and the l-∝ quasi-norm, while the other algorithm extends the binary iterative hard thresholding algorithm to the multiple measurement vector case. Second, we consider a decentralized setting where each node transmits 1-b measurements to its one-hop neighbors. The basic idea behind the algorithms developed in the decentralized setting is to embed collaboration among nodes and fusion strategies. We show that even with noisy 1-b compressed measurements, joint support recovery can be carried out accurately in both centralized and decentralized settings. We further show that the performance of the proposed 1-bit compressive sensing-based algorithms is very close to that of their real-valued counterparts except when the signal-to-noise ratio is very small.","2373-776X","","10.1109/TSIPN.2018.2838038","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-14-1-0339); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(grant numbers:DE-AC52-07NA27344); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8360527","Compressive sensing;distributed sensor networks;quantization;common sparsity pattern recovery;binary iterative hard thresholding","Signal to noise ratio;Indexes;Measurement uncertainty;Information processing;Compressed sensing;Decoding;Iterative algorithms","compressed sensing;distributed sensors;iterative methods;maximum likelihood decoding;quantisation (signal);signal reconstruction;vectors","measurement vector case;vector element-wise;1-bit compressive sensing-based algorithms;centralized settings;joint support recovery;binary iterative hard thresholding algorithm;centralized setting;computationally tractable algorithms;maximum likelihood decoder;1-bit quantized measurements;central fusion center;sparse signals;joint sparse support recovery;distributed sensor network;joint sparsity pattern recovery","","8","","53","IEEE","17 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to different forms of original information, two suboptimal Kalman filters are presented based on quantized measurements (KFQM) and quantized innovations (KFQI) respectively.

Assuming the users learn their direct and interfering channels perfectly, they can feed back this information to the base stations (BSs) over the uplink channels. The BSs then use the channel information to design their transmission scheme. Two types of feedback are considered: 1) analog and 2) digital. In the analog feedback case, the users send their unquantized and uncoded channel state information (CSI) over the uplink channels. In this context, given a user's fixed transmit power, we investigate how he/she should optimally allocate it to feed back the direct and interfering (or cross) CSI for two types of BS cooperation schemes, namely, multicell processing (MCP) and coordinated beamforming. In the digital feedback case, the direct and cross link channel vectors of each user are quantized separately, each using the random vector quantization scheme, with different size codebooks. The users then send the index of the quantization vector in the corresponding codebook to the BSs. Similar to the feedback optimization problem for the analog feedback, we investigate the optimal bit partitioning for the direct and interfering link for both types of cooperation. We focus on regularized channel inversion precoding structures and perform our analysis in the large system limit in which the number of users per cell (K) and the number of antennas per BS (N) tend to infinity with their ratio β = (K/N) held fixed. We show that for both types of cooperation, for some values of interfering channel gain, usually at low values, no cooperation between the BSs is preferred. This is because, for these values of cross channel gain, the channel estimates for the cross link are not accurate enough for their knowledge to contribute to improving the SINR and there is no benefit in doing BS cooperation under that condition. We also show that for the MCP scheme, unlike in the perfect CSI case, the SINR improves only when the interfering channel gain is above a certain threshold.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2014.2314092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779600","Wireless communications;cellular networks;cooperative beamforming;limited feedback;large system analysis","Interference;Channel estimation;Base stations;Signal to noise ratio;Optimization;Vectors;Training","array signal processing;broadcast channels;channel allocation;channel coding;cooperative communication;feedback;interference suppression;MIMO communication;precoding;random processes;vector quantisation","base station cooperation;large system analysis;signal to interference plus noise ratio;SINR;two cell MIMO broadcast channel;multiple input multiple output;interfering channel;uplink channel;analog feedback;unquantized CSI;uncoded CSI;channel state information;optimal channel allocation;BS cooperation scheme;multicell processing;MCP;coordinated beamforming;digital feedback;cross link channel vector;regularized channel inversion precoding structure;optimal bit partitioning;feedback optimization problem;codebook;random vector quantization scheme;direct channel vector","","15","","47","IEEE","27 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When k = 1, we exactly solve the extremal problem of maximizing this geometric quantity for the Gaussian location model, which allows us to conclude that in this model, a halfspace quantization is the one-bit quantization that maximizes Tr(IM(θ)). Under assumptions on the tail of the distribution of Sθ(X) projected onto any unit vector in ℝd, we give upper bounds demonstrating how Tr(IM(θ)) can scale with k. We apply these results to find lower bounds on the minimax risk of estimating θ from multiple quantized samples of X, for example in a distributed setting where the samples are distributed across multiple nodes and each node has a total budget of k-bits to communicate its sample to a centralized estimator. Our bounds apply in a unified way to many common statistical models including the Gaussian location model and discrete distribution estimation, and they recover and generalize existing results in the literature with simpler and more transparent proofs.","","978-1-5386-6596-1","10.1109/ALLERTON.2018.8635899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8635899","","Quantization (signal);Upper bound;Random variables;Estimation;Silicon;Context modeling;Density measurement","computational geometry;estimation theory;Gaussian processes;matrix algebra;minimax techniques;statistical analysis;statistical distributions;vectors","discrete distribution estimation;geometric characterization;distributed statistical estimation;statistical sample;k-bit quantization;Fisher information matrix;geometric quantity;Gaussian location model;halfspace quantization;one-bit quantization;centralized estimator;common statistical models","","5","","18","","7 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis of the nonlinearity introduced by the encoder quantization allows improving the behaviour of the filter in all the speed range. A Kalman filter type observer has been developed. The main novelty is that the state estimate observational update takes place at the quantized position signal discontinuities. Unlike the usually, applied Kalman filter, the measurement noise covariance is variable. In this observer, it is a function of the shaft speed because the selection of the sampling instant results in a reduction of the output noise covariance. The observer adapts its gain depending on the state variables. The optimal gain calculation results in an observer bandwidth increase. Another advantage of this observer is that the self-sustained. oscillations are suppressed, obtaining asymptotic stability.","","0-7803-7262-X","10.1109/PSEC.2002.1022509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022509","","Torque;Shafts;Observers;Analytical models;Quantization;Filters;State estimation;Noise measurement;Sampling methods;Noise reduction","squirrel cage motors;machine vector control;control system synthesis;machine theory;torque control;velocity control;observers;control system analysis computing;electric machine analysis computing;Kalman filters;asymptotic stability","speed observer;squirrel cage induction motor;vector control design;disturbance torque observer;nonlinearity analysis;Kalman filter type observer;state estimate observational update;quantized position signal discontinuities;variable measurement noise covariance;output noise covariance;control simulation;computer simulation;gain adaptation;optimal gain calculation;observer bandwidth;self-sustained oscillations suppression;asymptotic stability","","8","","12","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The implementation of a basic vector-tracking observer topology is discussed. To reduce the remaining position estimation errors, two improvements are introduced: speed dependent observer gains and a reduction of the harmonic content in the input vector of the vector-tracking observer. These result in a sufficiently low position estimation error. The performance of the vectortracking observer is studied in steady state and in transient state by simulation as well as experiments on a hardware setup.","","978-1-4244-4174-7","10.1109/ICELMACH.2010.5608255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5608255","Low-resolution sensor;permanent-magnet machines;position estimation;torque control;vector control;vectortracking observer","Harmonic analysis;Quantization;Estimation error;Observers;Torque;Rotors","machine vector control;observers;permanent magnet machines;position measurement;rotors;sensors;synchronous machines","rotor position estimation;permanent-magnet synchronous machine;low-resolution position sensor;vector control;vector-tracking observer;error estimation;speed dependent observer gain;harmonic content reduction","","3","","12","","25 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For bag of keypoints, the descriptors of detected interest points are quantized by k-means clustering and are converted into a feature vector element. The figure classification is carried out using a one-against-all multi-class support vector machine. When the Harris-affine and extended scale-invariant feature transform method are used for interest point detection and feature description, respectively, the classification accuracy of bag of keypoints is about 20% better than that of field-level image descriptors which are similar to descriptors used in previous studies. Further, when bag of words for legends is combined with this method, the prediction performance achieved 75.7% classification accuracy. Introducing bag of keypoints not only increases the classification performance but also enables the figures to be treated as text words.

We utilize an MPEG style codec in which the anchor frames in a sequence are encoded with a hybrid approach using quadtree, DCT, and wavelet-based coding techniques. A quadtree structured approach is also utilized for the interframe information. The main objective of the overall design is to demonstrate the coding potential of a newly developed motion estimator called the coupled linearized MAP (CLMAP) estimator. This estimator can be used as a means for producing motion vectors that may be regenerated at the decoder with a coarsely quantized error term created in the encoder. The motion estimator generates highly accurate motion estimates from this coarsely quantized data. This permits the elimination of a separately coded displaced frame difference (DFD) and coded motion vectors. For low bit rate applications, this is especially important because the overhead associated with the transmission of motion vectors may become prohibitive. We exploit both the advantages of the nonstationary motion estimator and the effective compression of the anchor frame coder to improve the visual quality of reconstructed QCIF format color image sequences at low bit rates.

Firstly, the original image was decomposed into curvelet coefficients using fast discrete curvelet transform. Then different scales of quantized curvelet coefficients were selected for lossy compression and entropy encoding. For example, the lowest subband is encoded by differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) for including most image energy. The finer scale subbands are compressed by SVM regression, which approximates the curvelet coefficients using a fewer support vectors and weights.

We investigate optimal resource allocation strategies that minimize the MSE bound, subject to total bandwidth (measured in quantization bits) and total transmit power constraints. The bound consists of two terms, where the first and second terms, respectively, account for the MSE distortion due to quantization and communication channel errors. Therefore, we find the bit allocation that minimizes the first distortion term. Given the optimal bit allocation, we obtain the power allocation that minimizes the second distortion term.

Color clustering and filtering using approximations of the YCbCr and HSV skin color subspaces are applied on the original image, providing quantized skin color regions. A merging stage is then iteratively performed on the set of homogeneous skin color regions in the color quantized image, in order to provide a set of potential face areas. Constraints related to shape and size of faces are applied, and face intensity texture is analyzed by performing a wavelet packet decomposition on each face area candidate in order to detect human faces. The wavelet coefficients of the band filtered images characterize the face texture and a set of simple statistical deviations is extracted in order to form compact and meaningful feature vectors.

Optimum precoders require a fairly detailed description of the channel singular vectors motivating the use of limited feedback communications to send some quantized form of the precoder to the transmitter. To this end, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is the fundamental step in extracting the singular vectors of the channel. In this paper we revisit a limited feedback technique based on the quantization of the dominant right singular vector of the channel matrix. Lifting the assumption of perfect channel estimation at the receiver, we investigate channels affected by Gaussian noise, line of sight component, and phase uncertainty. We also assume a more general channel model that incorporates channel correlations.

The limited feedback systems are then practically developed to convey the quantized CDI to the transmitter. Using the quantized CDI to conduct the THP, an unavoidable interference degrades the performance at the receiver. In this paper, we investigate the performance degradation resulted from the random vector quantization (RVQ), which is a kind of CDI-based limited feedback mechanism. Here, we measure the performance degradation as the excess mean-squared error (EMSE). Since the formulation of the EMSE is a complicated function of the quantization error, we proposed using the second-order Taylor expansion to derive an analytical result.

Previously, we have proposed a very simple yet highly reliable face recognition algorithm using Adjacent Pixel Intensity Difference Quantization (APIDQ) histogram. After the intensity variation vectors for all the pixels in an image are calculated, each vector is quantized directly in (dIx, dIy) plane instead of polar plane. By counting the number of elements in each quantized area in the (dIx, dIy) plane, a histogram can be created. This histogram, obtained by APIDQ for facial images, is utilized as a very effective personal feature.

The histogram modification technique based on quantized DCT coefficients of coded macro blocks is used to achieve loss less recovery after data extraction. If a macro block in the ROI is found missing at the decoder, the embedded motion vector can be extracted from the corresponding host macro block for the recovery of the missing macro block.

It is assumed that there exists a per-antenna power constraint at the transmitter, hence, the equal gain transmission (EGT) beamforming vector is quantized and sent from the receiver to the transmitter. The loss in received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to perfect beamforming is analytically characterized, and it is shown that at high rates, the overall distortion can be expressed as the sum of the quantization-induced distortion and the channel error-induced distortion, and that the asymptotic performance depends on the error-rate behavior of the noisy feedback channel as the number of codepoints gets large. The optimum density of codepoints (also known as the point density) that minimizes the overall distortion subject to a boundedness constraint is shown to be the same as the point density for a noiseless feedback channel, i.e., the uniform density. The binary symmetric channel with random index assignment is a special case of the analysis, and it is shown that as the number of quantized bits gets large the distortion approaches the same as that obtained with random beamforming.

However, theoretical studies indicate that wavelets are not the ideal image descriptors; they have very crude directional representations and are not anisotropic. A recent development called the Curvelet Transform tries to overcome these shortcomings of wavelets. In this paper, we propose a multiresolution Curvelet based method for face recognition. Recognition will be done in three steps. In the first step the original 8 bit image is quantized to 4 bit and 2 bit representations. In the second step, each of the 3 different resolved versions of the image are subjected to Curvelet transform at five different resolutions. The approximate Curvelet coefficients at each resolution represent a different feature set. In the last step these fifteen (three bit resolved version x five resolutions) sets of coefficients are then used to train separate Support Vector Machines. During testing, the results of the fifteen SVMs are fused to determine the final result.","","0-7695-3050-8","10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4426695","","Face recognition;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Humans;Application software;Wavelet transforms;Computer vision;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Image representation;Quantization","","","","4","","5","","7 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each agent is capable of updating its state based on the states of its neighbors, and there is a leader agent in the network that is allowed to update its state in arbitrary ways (within the discrete set) in order to put all agents in a desired state. We present a novel solution to this problem by viewing the discrete states of the system as elements of a finite field. Specifically, we develop a theory of structured linear systems over finite fields, and show that such systems will be controllable provided that the size of the finite field is sufficiently large, and that the graph associated with the system satisfies certain properties. We then use these results to show that a multi-agent system with a leader node is controllable via a linear nearest-neighbor update as long as there is a path from the leader to every node, and that the number of discrete states for each node is large enough.","2378-5861","978-1-4244-7427-1","10.1109/ACC.2010.5530721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5530721","","Control systems;Multiagent systems;Nearest neighbor searches;Galois fields;Linear systems;Network topology;Quantization;Vectors;Size control;Systems engineering and theory","graph theory;linear systems;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems","quantized multi-agent systems;linear nearest neighbor rules;leader agent;discrete states;structured linear systems;finite field approach","","2","","21","","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The image features based on micro-descriptors such as local binary patterns (LBP) and local ternary patterns (LTP) have been very successful in number of applications including face recognition and texture analysis. Instead of binary quantization in LBP, LTP thresholds the differential values between a focused pixel and its neighborhood pixels into three graylevel, which can be explained as the active status (i.e., positively activated, negatively activated and not activated) of the neighborhood pixels compared to the focused pixel. However, regardless to the magnitude of the focused pixel, the thresholding strategy remains fixed, which would violate the principle of human perception. Therefore, in this study, we design LTP with a data-driven threshold according to Weber's law, a human perception principle; further, our approach incorporates the contexts of spatial and orientation co-occurrences (i.e., co-occurrence context) among adjacent Weber-based local ternary patterns (WLTPs) for texture representation. In order to validate efficiency of our proposed strategy, we apply to three different visual recognition applications including two texture datasets and one food image dataset, and prove the promising performance can be achieved compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.","2327-0985","978-1-4799-6100-9","10.1109/ACPR.2015.7486617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7486617","","Context;Visualization;Indexes;Quantization (signal);Image recognition;Histograms;Support vector machines","face recognition;image representation;image segmentation;image texture","spatial cooccurrence context;data-driven quantized local ternary patterns;visual recognition;local image texture representation descriptor;microdescriptors;local binary patterns;LBP;adjacent Weber-based local ternary patterns;WLTP;face recognition;texture analysis;differential values;neighborhood pixels;focused pixel;human perception principle;data-driven threshold;Weber's law;orientation cooccurrence context;texture datasets;food image dataset","","","","15","","9 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For gesture, orientation of two consecutive hand centroid points is computed which is then quantized to generate code words. HMM is trained by Baum Welch algorithm and classified by Viterbi path algorithm. In posture recognition, American Sign Language is recognized for static alphabets and numbers. Feature vectors are computed from statistical and geometrical properties of the hand and are used to train SVM for classification and recognition. Moreover, curvature analysis is carried out for alphabets to avoid misclassifications.

Instead, a vector predictive quantizer is proposed that combines prediction and differential quantization algorithms to achieve an efficient quantization of the correlated Grassmannian source. The proposed predictor is based on adaptive finite impulse response filters to adjust to the temporal statistics of the source signal. It is shown that the prediction error in the tangent space associated with the Grassmann manifold behaves approximately Gaussian, provided its norm is sufficiently small. The proposed quantization algorithm is applied to channel state information quantization in multi-user beamforming wireless communication systems.

At the core of this approach are two trained codebooks of the quantized feature vectors of speakers, whereby the main evaluation for separation is performed. The simulation results show that the proposed transformation offers an attractive candidate to improve the separation performance of model-based SCSS.

In theory, a performance arbitrarily close to the ultimate rate-distortion limit is achievable with waveform vector quantization if the dimension of the vector,k, is large enough. The main obstacle in effectively using vector quantization is complexity. A vector quantizer of dimensionkoperating at a rate ofrbits/sample requires a number of computations on the order ofk2^{kr}and a memory of the same order. However, a low-dimensional vector quantizer (dimensions 4-8) achieves a remarkable improvement over scalar quantization (PCM). Consequently, using the vector quantizer as a building block and imbedding it with other waveform data compression techniques may lead to the development of a new and powerful class of waveform coding systems. This paper proposes and analyzes a waveform coding system, adaptive vector predictive coding (AVPC), in which a low-dimensionality vector quantizer is used in an adaptive predictive coding scheme. In the encoding process, a locally generated prediction of the current input vector is subtracted from the current vector, and the resulting error vector is coded by a vector quantizer. Each frame consisting of many vectors is classified into one ofmstatistical types. This classification determines which one ofmfixed predictors and ofmvector quantizers will be used for encoding the current frame.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOM.1985.1096372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1096372","","Predictive coding;Speech coding;Phase change materials;Vector quantization;Data compression;Encoding;Statistics;Rate-distortion;Adaptive systems;Code standards","","Quantization (signal);Signal quantization;Speech coding","","145","117","27","","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MP3 double compression, achieved by decompressing and recompressing audio to a different compression ratio, is a typical manipulation of audio for malicious purposes. In this paper, we propose an approach for detecting both up-transcoded and down-transcoded MP3 audio files and revealing the real compression quality based on statistical patterns extracted from quantized MDCT coefficients and their derivatives. To minimize the false prediction caused by individual characteristics of diversified audio clips, we generated reference audio signals by recompressing and calibrating the audio, and measured the differences between signal-based and reference-based features. Support vector machines and dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference systems were applied for binary and multi-class classifications.

It is well-known that in such a scenario, finite-rate FLQs cannot achieve the full-CSIT (zero distortion) outage performance. We construct VLQs that can achieve the full-CSIT performance with finite rate. In particular, with P denoting the power constraint of the transmitter, we show that the necessary and sufficient VLQ rate that guarantees the full-CSIT performance is Θ(1/P).

This property can be exploited for obtaining accurate signal representations with low resolution quantization, and it has been used in oversampled A/D conversion. A problem with this approach to source coding is that the bit-rate increases linearly with expansion redundancy giving poor rate-distortion performances. Entropy coding schemes that could remedy the problem of fast increase of the bit-rate have not yet been studied in general. An example of a redundant expansion which is amenable to efficient encoding of quantized samples is discussed. A quantitative characterization of noise reduction properties of redundant expansions is given first. Then, a subband coding scheme based on overcomplete short-time Fourier expansions and low resolution quantization is discussed. This scheme allows for efficient lossless encoding of quantized expansion coefficients, with a logarithmic increase of the bit-rate with redundancy.

The processing consists of three stages: preprocessing, c-means clustering, and creation of the output image. The main goal of the first stage is to transform the pixel matrix into a list of records, which indicates what colors are present in the image and how many times they appear. To achieve this, first we apply a static color quantization scheme that aligns the 16.7 million possible colors with 140 thousand grid points, and build the histogram of this quantized image. Then we mark least frequent quantized colors to be ignored during the clustering stage, the amount of such marks being controlled by the pixel inclusion parameter. Leaving out 2-5% of the image pixels can reduce the number of colors to 500-5000 in most images. This limited set of colors together with frequency information consists the input of the c-means clustering process performed in the second stage. Before creating the final output image, the marked quantized colors are mapped to the closest cluster. Thorough numerical tests were performed on 500 randomly chosen images using both fuzzy and hard c-means clustering. Evaluations revealed that hard c-means is more suitable than fuzzy c-means for the given problem, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Central to the approach is the use of a lossy version of the Lempel-Ziv incremental parsing (LZIP) algorithm, which constructs a dictionary by incrementally parsing music feature vectors. LZIP is adopted as a source characterization technique owing to it's universal-coding nature, and asymptotic convergence to the entropy of the source. The dictionary is composed of variable-length parsed representations, which are used to construct a highly sparse co-occurrence matrix, which counts the occurrence of the parsed representations in each music. As a feature analysis framework, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is then applied to the co-occurrence matrix to generate a lower-dimensional approximation that exposes the most salient features of the represented audio documents. The aforementioned approach, in addition to adopting reduced sampling rates and quantized feature vectors, yields a system with reduced requirements in terms of processing and storage, and increases the tolerance to noisy queries. We demonstrate the performance of the system in the music genre classification problem, and analyze its robustness to perturbed queries. Moreover, we demonstrate that using the incremental parsing algorithm in forming the audio dictionary has superior retrieval performance compared to techniques yielding a dictionary with fixed-length entries such as vector quantization.","2379-190X","978-1-4244-4295-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5496245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496245","Music retrieval;incremental parsing;feature extraction;Lempel-Ziv;vector quantization","Feature extraction;Indexing;Dictionaries;Music information retrieval;Sparse matrices;Content based retrieval;Convergence;Entropy;Sampling methods;Noise reduction","computational linguistics;content-based retrieval;dictionaries;feature extraction;music;sparse matrices;vector quantisation","feature extraction;music indexing;linguistic processing approach;content based retrieval;Lempel-Ziv incremental parsing algorithm;music feature vector;source characterization technique;universal coding nature;asymptotic convergence;variable length parsed representation;sparse cooccurrence matrix;latent semantic analysis;audio document;audio dictionary;vector quantization","","1","","9","","28 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose product Quantized Collaborative Filtering (pQCF) for better trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. pQCF decomposes a joint latent space of users and items into a Cartesian product of low-dimensional subspaces, and learns clustered representation within each subspace. A latent factor is then represented by a short code, which is composed of subspace cluster indexes. A user's preference for an item can be efficiently calculated via table lookup. We then develop block coordinate descent for efficient optimization and reveal the learning of latent factors is seamlessly integrated with quantization. We further investigate an asymmetric pQCF, dubbed as QCF, where user latent factors are not quantized and shared across different subspaces. The extensive experiments with 6 real-world datasets show that pQCF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing-based CF and QCF increases recommendation accuracy compared to pQCF.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.2964232","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976198,U1605251,61832017,61631005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8950031","Recommendation;product quantization;collaborative filtering;maximum inner product search","Quantization (signal);Indexes;Collaboration;Approximation algorithms;Recommender systems","collaborative filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering;recommender systems;table lookup","strict response-time constraints;real-world recommender systems;index-based methods;hashing-based recommendation methods;low memory cost;Cartesian product;low-dimensional subspaces;clustered representation;subspace cluster indexes;asymmetric pQCF;product quantized collaborative filtering;hashing-based CF","","","","59","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We assume the FC employs the linear mean square error (LMMSE) estimator to estimate the unknown vector and the WSN is subject to total bandwidth (measured in quantization bits) and total transmit power constraints. We provide an upper bound on the mean square error (MSE) distortion at the FC and investigate the optimal quantization bit and transmit power allocation among sensors such that this bound is minimized. The bound consists of two terms, where the first and second terms, respectively, account for the MSE distortion due to quantization and communication channel errors. Therefore, we find the bit allocation that minimizes the first distortion term. Given the optimal bit allocation, we obtain the power allocation that minimizes the second distortion term.

The use of properties of the human visual system can increase the performance of such a system and allow one to achieve very high quality reconstructed images at compression ratios exceeding 10:1. The authors design a color subband-vector quantization system, and formulate the bit allocation problem as an optimization problem where the objective function depends on the distortion-rate curves of the quantizers and on a set of perceptual weights. These weights are derived from data provided by measurements of the mean detection threshold of the human visual system for color transitions along the luminance, red-green, and blue-yellow directions. Minimization of the objective function constrained by the desired bit rate gives a perceptually optimal bit allocation. Three subband/VQ cases are examined. In the first two cases (case 1 and case 2), the color components of the lowest frequency subband are scalar quantized. Case 1 combines the three color components of each pixel of the higher frequency subbands into a three-dimensional vector, while case 2 creates four-dimensional vectors from 2/spl times/2 blocks in each subband color component. The third case (case 3) is the same as case 2, except that the chrominance components of the lowest frequency subband are also vector quantized with 2/spl times/2 blocks in each component. To obtain the required compression ratio and the high color fidelity required for HDTV applications, the vector quantization is done in C.I.E.

A binary symmetric channel (BSC) model characterizes feedback errors. Two cases are studied: first, when the BSC bit error probability is known a priori to the transmission ends, and second, when it is not known exactly. Based on a minimum pairwise error probability (PEP) design criterion, we design a channel optimized vector quantizer (COVQ) for feedback information and a precoder matrix codebook to adjust the transmission codewords. The attractive property of our combining scheme is that it converges to conventional space-time coding with low-rate and erroneous feedback and to directional beamforming with high-rate and error-free feedback.

To reduce the frequency of communication, we develop a novel event-triggered distributed learning rule that is based on the principle of diffusing low beliefs on each false hypothesis. Building on this principle, we design a trigger condition under which an agent broadcasts only those components of its belief vector that have adequate innovation, to only those neighbors that require such information. We prove that our rule guarantees convergence to the true state exponentially fast almost surely despite sparse communication, and that it has the potential to significantly reduce information flow from uninformative agents to informative agents. Next, to deal with finite-precision communication channels, we propose a distributed learning rule that leverages the idea of adaptive quantization. We show that by sequentially refining the range of the quantizers, every agent can learn the truth exponentially fast almost surely, while using just 1 bit to encode its belief on each hypothesis.

The essence of product quantization is to decompose the original high-dimensional space into the Cartesian product of a finite number of low-dimensional subspaces that are then quantized separately. Optimal space decomposition is important for the performance of ANN search, but still remains unaddressed. In this paper, we optimize product quantization by minimizing quantization distortions w.r.t. the space decomposition and the quantization codebooks. We present two novel methods for optimization: a non-parametric method that alternatively solves two smaller sub-problems, and a parametric method that is guaranteed to achieve the optimal solution if the input data follows some Gaussian distribution. We show by experiments that our optimized approach substantially improves the accuracy of product quantization for ANN search.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-5672-3","10.1109/CVPR.2013.379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6619223","nearest neighbor search;product quantization","Quantization (signal);Artificial neural networks;Vectors;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Linear programming;Encoding;Optimization","computer vision;Gaussian distribution;optimisation;search problems;vector quantisation","optimized product quantization;approximate nearest neighbor search;vector quantization approach;high-dimensional vectors;Cartesian product;low-dimensional subspaces;optimal space decomposition;ANN search;quantization distortions;space decomposition;quantization codebooks;optimization;nonparametric method;parametric method;Gaussian distribution;computer vision","","173","2","20","","3 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"JPEG optimization using an entropy-constrained quantization framework","M.

In this work, by developing an entropy-constrained quantization framework, we show that these previous works do not fully realize the attainable coding gain, and then formulate a computationally efficient way that attempts to fully realize this gain for baseline-JPEG-decodable systems. Interestingly, we find that the gains obtained using the previous algorithms are almost additive. The framework involves viewing a scalar-quantized system with fixed quantizers as a special type of vector quantizer (VQ), and then to use techniques akin to entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) to optimize the system. In the JPEG case, a computationally efficient algorithm can be derived, without training, by jointly performing coefficient thresholding, quantizer selection, and Huffman table customization, all compatible with the baseline JPEG syntax. Our algorithm achieves significant R-D improvement over standard JPEG (about 2 dB for typical images) with performance comparable to that of more complex ""state-of-the-art"" coders. For example, for the Lenna image coded at 1.0 bits per pixel, our JPEG-compatible coder achieves a PSNR of 39.6 dB, which even slightly exceeds the published performance of Shapiro's wavelet coder. Although PSNR does not guarantee subjective performance, our algorithm can be applied with a flexible range of visually-based distortion metrics.","1068-0314","0-8186-7012-6","10.1109/DCC.1995.515524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=515524","","Rate-distortion;Image storage;Decoding;Algorithm design and analysis;Transform coding;Vector quantization;Constraint optimization;PSNR;Code standards;Pixel","encoding;vector quantisation;optimisation","JPEG optimization;entropy-constrained quantization framework;adaptive quantizer selection;adaptive coefficient thresholding;JPEG coder;baseline-JPEG-decodable systems;vector quantizer;entropy-constrained vector quantization;Huffman table customization","","12","1","12","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, multiple-solution inpainting methods have been proposed and shown the potential of generating diverse results. However, these methods have difficulty in ensuring the quality of each solution, e.g. they produce distorted structure and/or blurry texture. We propose a two-stage model for diverse inpainting, where the first stage generates multiple coarse results each of which has a different structure, and the second stage refines each coarse result separately by augmenting texture. The proposed model is inspired by the hierarchical vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), whose hierarchical architecture disentangles structural and textural information. In addition, the vector quantization in VQVAE enables autoregressive modeling of the discrete distribution over the structural information. Sampling from the distribution can easily generate diverse and high-quality structures, making up the first stage of our model. In the second stage, we propose a structural attention module inside the texture generation network, where the module utilizes the structural information to capture distant correlations. We further reuse the VQ-VAE to calculate two feature losses, which help improve structure coherence and texture realism, respectively. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets show that our method not only enhances the diversity of the inpainting solutions but also improves the visual quality of the generated multiple images.

Performances of the latter solutions still need to be improved to decrease this gap. The main difficulty comes from the fact that fingerprint captures of the same trait give very different minutiae sets with possibly small overlaps and very different distortions among the different part of the images; and comparison of a stored reference with the fresh captured fingerprint data has to take into account those local variabilities. In this paper, we study a new approach to this problem by exhibiting a way to transform a minutiae set into a quantized feature vector by local comparisons. The encoding of the original fingerprint template is made by matching small minutiae vicinities with a set of representative vicinities. Moreover, the representation achieves the interesting property of self-alignment of the vectors.","","978-1-4244-7582-7","10.1109/BTAS.2010.5634488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5634488","Fingerprint;Feature Vector;Binarization;Self-alignment","Databases;Quantization;Feature extraction;Bioinformatics;Histograms;Transforms;Encoding","fingerprint identification;image matching;security of data","binary feature vector fingerprint representation;minutiae vicinities;fingerprint matching;biometric privacy protection purpose","","56","1","38","","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because different networks may have different bandwidths, a gateway can include a transcoder to adapt the video bit rates in order to provide video services to users on different networks. In transcoding, motion estimation is usually not performed in the transcoder because of its heavy computational complexity. To speed up the operation, a video transcoder usually reuses the decoded motion vectors (MVs) from the incoming bitstream. Previously, the bilinear interpolation and forward dominant vector selection methods were proposed to compose the missing MVs for reuse. We propose a new algorithm, called the activity dominant vector selection, which utilizes the quantized discrete cosine transform coefficients of residual blocks for composing a MV from the incoming ones. In addition, a motion-vector refinement algorithm called variable step-size search is presented. The performance can be improved while maintaining low computational complexity for a reduced frame-rate video transcoder.","1558-2205","","10.1109/76.999204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=999204","","Streaming media;Bit rate;Bandwidth;Computational complexity;Communication channels;Transcoding;Motion estimation;Decoding;Interpolation;Discrete cosine transforms","motion estimation;discrete cosine transforms;video coding;multimedia communication;telecommunication channels;transform coding;computational complexity;quantisation (signal)","motion estimation;reduced frame-rate;video transcoder;multimedia applications;available bandwidth;communication channels;computational complexity;decoded motion vectors;bilinear interpolation;forward dominant vector selection;activity dominant vector selection;discrete cosine transform;quantized transform coefficients;variable step-size search;video coding;DCT","","54","","15","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The nonlinear prediction is constructed, based on its analytical form derived in detail in this paper, as a parameter-free, discrete mapping function that approximates the “forward” relationship from the resonance frequencies and bandwidths to the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) cepstra of real speech. Discretization of the function permits the “inversion” of the function via a search operation. We further introduce the nonlinear-prediction residual, characterized by a multivariate Gaussian vector with trainable mean vectors and covariance matrices, to account for the errors due to the functional approximation. We develop and describe an expectation–maximization (EM)-based algorithm for training the parameters of the residual, and a dynamic programming-based algorithm for resonance tracking. Details of the algorithm implementation for computation speedup are provided.

In the first part, we propose a specific indexing method to make MLVQ with a multidimensional codebook feasible. Furthermore, a quantization parameter estimation was designed to ensure the invertibility of the embedding. The limitations of the compression performance of JWC schemes are studied in the second part. We show the existence of a coding rate lower bound which depends mainly on the codebook characteristics and dramatically decreases coding performance. To circumvent this drawback, two improved MLVQ schemes are proposed. In the first one, called arbitrary MLVQ, the embedding is performed on part of the signal to ensure a low embedding/coding ratio. In the second one, called deadzone MLVQ, the coding efficiency is further improved by maintaining the sparsity of the quantized host signal.

Recently, deep learning (DL) based WII methods have been proposed with impressive performances. However, these methods did not consider the quantization problem for DL based methods of WII, which is an indispensable process when deploying deep neural networks into hardware units. This paper addresses the problem of training quantized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with low-precision weights as well as activations for WII. Optimizing a low-bit width network is very challenging due to the non-differentiable quantization function. To mitigate the difficulty of training, we propose three effective approaches. Firstly, we propose to train the quantized network with the guidance of the full-precision counterpart. The quantized network can learn from the full-precision counterpart. Unfortunately, training an extra full-precision network to assist a quantized model is cumbersome and computationally expensive. To this end, we further propose a training mechanism which makes use of the manually designed probability distributions to provide a virtual full-precision counterpart for guiding the training of the quantization network without extra computational cost. Thirdly, to make the gradient back-propagates more easily, we propose novel auxiliary output modules, which can be seamlessly incorporated into the proposed quantization networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Furthermore, it is shown that training 3-bit and 4-bit precision networks with the proposed methods leads to performance improvement as compared to their full precision counterparts with standard network architectures.","2332-7731","","10.1109/TCCN.2022.3149092","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62131005,U19B2014); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:254); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9703679","Wireless interference identification;cognitive radio;convolutional neural networks;low-precision network;quantization function","Interference;Training;Quantization (signal);Wireless communication;Time-frequency analysis;Neural networks;Mathematical models","convolutional neural nets;cooperative communication;deep learning (artificial intelligence);interference (signal);optimisation;probability;quantisation (signal);radiocommunication;telecommunication computing;vector quantisation","quantization problem;DL based methods;deep neural networks;low-precision weights;low-bit width network;nondifferentiable quantization function;quantized network;full-precision network;quantized model;virtual full-precision counterpart;quantization network;training 3-bit;4-bit precision networks;precision counterparts;standard network architectures;low-bitwidth convolutional neural networks;wireless interference identification;WII methods","","1","","50","IEEE","4 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous analyses of this problem based on generalized restricted isometry properties have suggested that two phenomena occur if p ≠ 2. First, one may need substantially more than s log(en/s) measurements (optimal for p = 2) for uniform recovery of all s-sparse vectors. Second, the matrix that achieves recovery with the optimal number of measurements may not be Gaussian (as for p = 2). We present a new, direct analysis, which shows that in fact neither of these phenomena occur.

To bridge the coding performance of vector quantization with the low complexity of the scalar case, we propose an iterative approach for entropy coding the spectral envelope parameters. For each parameter, a univariate probability distribution is derived from a Gaussian mixture model of the joint distribution and the previously quantized parameters used as a-priori information. Parameters are then iteratively and individually scalar quantized and entropy coded. Unlike vector quantization, the complexity of proposed method does not increase exponentially with dimension and bitrate. Moreover, the coding resolution and dimension can be adaptively modified without retraining the model.

The scheduled users are then polled in the second stage to feedback their quantized channel vectors. This paper proposes an analytical framework to show that, under a total feedback budget of B bits, the number of bits assigned to the second feedback stage should scale as log B, and in quantizing channel vectors from different base-stations, each user should allocate feedback bits in proportion to the channel magnitudes in dB scale. Under these optimized bit allocations, the overall sum rate of the system is shown to scale double-logarithmically with B, linearly with the total number of antennas, and logarithmically with transmit power, thus achieving both multiuser diversity and spatial multiplexing gains under limited feedback.

The performance of this system in uncorrelated Rayleigh flat fading channels is studied from the point-of-view of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and outage probability. In this paper, lower bounds are derived on the expected SNR loss and the outage probability of systems that have a single receive antenna or two transmit antennas. For arbitrary transmit and receive antennas, approximations for the SNR loss and outage are derived. In particular, the SNR loss in a quantized MIMO beamforming system is characterized as a function of the number of quantization bits and the number of transmit and receive antennas.

While conventional VP requires the feedback of the channel matrix at the transmitter for precoding and the power scaling factor at the receivers for detection, VP precoding has so far been developed and analyzed under assumptions that the transmitter has perfect channel state information (CSI) or the receivers have perfect knowledge of the channel- and data-dependent power scaling factors. In practical limited feedback scenarios, wireless communication systems suffer from limited time and frequency resource for pilots to feed-forward information and only a quantized version of power scaling factors is available at the receivers; under such limitations, the performance of VP precoding will degrade significantly compared with ideal scenarios and would always encounter an error floor at mid-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Motivated by such observations, we propose a robust VP precoder design, which takes the imperfectness of CSI and power scaling factor jointly into account under the criterion of minimum mean-square error (MMSE). The closed-form expressions of the proposed precoder are then derived. As illustrated by the simulation results, the proposed VP precoder is less sensitive to CSI and power scaling factor imperfections compared with the classic VP precoder and other existing MMSE-based VP precoders, as it has a lower error floor when imperfectness is assumed to be fixed, and power scaling factor accuracy is shown to offer a non-linear performance gain compared with that of the linear gain CSI accuracy could offer.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926228","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFF0301201); State Key Laboratory of Wireless Mobile Communications, China Academy of Telecommunication Technology (CATT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753485","Imperfect channel state information (CSI);multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel;non-linear precoding;power scaling factor;vector perturbation (VP)","Precoding;Receivers;Transmitters;Signal to noise ratio;Perturbation methods;MIMO communication;Antennas","antenna arrays;broadcast channels;least mean squares methods;matrix algebra;multiuser channels;precoding;radio transmitters;wireless channels","centralized transmitter;conventional VP;channel matrix;VP precoding;perfect channel state information;data-dependent power scaling factors;wireless communication systems;robust VP precoder design;imperfectness;power scaling factor imperfections;classic VP precoder;power scaling factor accuracy;vector perturbation precoding;imperfect CSI;inaccurate power scaling factors;multiuser multiple-input-single-output broadcast channel systems;multiple single-antenna receivers;MMSE-based VP precoders;minimum mean-square error","","8","","28","CCBY","2 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a hybrid image compression scheme based on wavelet transform, HVS thresholding and L/sub /spl infin//-constrained adaptive context modelling. This hybrid system combines the strengths of the wavelet transform, the HVS thresholding and the adaptive context modelling to result in a near optimal compression scheme. The wavelet transform is very powerful in localizing the global spatial and frequency correlation. The HVS model-based thresholding is designed to exploit and eliminate the wavelet coefficients insensitive to the human visual system. The context-based modelling is superior in decorrelating the local redundancy. In the scheme, the image is first decomposed into the multiresolution subimages using the orthogonal wavelet transform; each subimage corresponds to a octave band in the wavelet decomposition. The coefficients in the high-pass octave bands of the wavelet transform are then quantized through HVS frequency- and spatial model-based thresholding and vector quantization into wavelet decomposition with only significant coefficients to the HVS retained. In this HVS quantized wavelet decomposition, the coefficients insignificant to the human visual system are normalized to zero and the global spatial and frequency correlation are exploited and removed. Then the quantized subimages in the low-pass band and the remaining high-pass octave bands of each octave level are processed using the L/sub /spl infin//-constrained CALIC to de-correlate the local redundancy. It is demonstrated that the hybrid scheme is one of the best compression schemes in achieving the excellent compression rates and competitive PSNR while maintaining a small visual distortion. In comparing with the original CALIC, we were able to increase the PSNR by 0.65 dB or more and obtain bit rates 15 percent lower than the latter. We were also able to obtain competitive PSNR results against the best wavelet coders, while maintaining a smaller visual distortion. In particular, the wavelet CALIC was able to obtain 1.34 to 7.84 dB higher PSNR on the standard ISO test benchmarks than the SPIHT, one of the best wavelet coder.","1068-0314","0-8186-8406-2","10.1109/DCC.1998.672235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=672235","","Image coding;Wavelet transforms;Power system modeling;PSNR;Context modeling;Frequency;Humans;Visual system;ISO standards;Wavelet coefficients","vector quantisation;image coding;image resolution;transform coding;wavelet transforms;adaptive signal processing;visual perception;correlation methods","high-pass octave bands;hybrid image compression;HVS thresholding;L/sub /spl infin//-constrained adaptive context modelling;near optimal compression;global frequency correlation;global spatial correlation;wavelet coefficients;human visual system;decorrelation;local redundancy;multiresolution subimages;orthogonal wavelet transform;vector quantization;wavelet decomposition;low-pass band;L/sub /spl infin//-constrained CALIC;compression rates;PSNR;visual distortion;bit rates;wavelet coders;standard ISO test benchmarks;SPIHT","","","","2","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a beamforming technique that reduces feedback requirements for optimal beamforming. In the proposed architecture, the receiver sends back quantized versions of select beamforming vectors and the transmitter reconstructs the missing beamforming vectors through interpolation. Since a beamforming vector is phase invariant and has unit norm, a new spherical linear interpolator is proposed that exploits additional parameters for phase rotation. These parameters are determined at the receiver in the sense of maximizing the minimum channel gain or capacity, and sent back to the transmitter along with the quantized beamforming vectors.

Thus, they can be used in a multitemporal framework to detect and discriminate between different kinds of fine spectral change effectively. However, due to the complexity of the problem and the limited amount of multitemporal images and reference data, only a few works in the literature addressed change detection (CD) in HS images. In this paper, we present a novel method for unsupervised multiple CD in multitemporal HS images based on a discrete representation of the change information. Differently from the state-of-the-art methods, which address the high dimensionality of the data using band reduction or selection techniques, in this paper, we focus our attention on the representation and exploitation of the change information present in each band. After a band-by-band pixel-based subtraction of the multitemporal images, we define the hyperspectral change vectors (HCVs). The change information in the HCVs is then simplified. To this end, the radiometric information of each band is separately analyzed to generate a quantized discrete representation of the HCVs. This discrete representation is explored by considering the hierarchical nature of the changes in HS images. A tree representation is defined and used to discriminate between different kinds of change. The proposed method has been tested on a simulated data set and two real multitemporal data sets acquired by the Hyperion sensor over agricultural areas. Experimental results confirm that the discrete representation of the change information is effective when used for unsupervised CD in multitemporal HS data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2894339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648482","Binary codewords;change detection (CD);hyperspectral (HS) images;multitemporal images","Hyperspectral imaging;Image coding;Principal component analysis;Complexity theory;Sea measurements;Encoding","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image resolution;object detection;remote sensing;spectral analysis;unsupervised learning","multitemporal hyperspectral images;binary hyperspectral change vectors;target spectral signatures;fine spectral change;multitemporal images;unsupervised multiple CD;multitemporal HS images;state-of-the-art methods;band reduction;band-by-band pixel-based subtraction;quantized discrete representation;multitemporal data sets;multitemporal HS data;change detection method;Hyperion sensor","","40","","64","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transition between different subsystems obeys a stochastic semi-Markov process related to nonexponential distribution. Additionally, due to the sensor information constraints, the state vectors are not always measurable in practice. Moreover, compared with existing results in literature, the output quantization is first considered for finite-time SMC problem via a logarithmic quantizer. Our attention is to design an appropriate finite-time SMC law to attenuate the influences of parametrical uncertainty and external disturbance onto the overall performance of the system under consideration. First, by the key points of stochastic semi-Markov Lyapunov function and observer design theory, a desired SMC law is constructed to guarantee that the system trajectories can arrive at the specified sliding surface (SSS) within an assigned finite-time level. Then, ST-dependent sufficient conditions are established to ensure the required finite-time boundedness performance including both reaching phase and sliding motion phase.

They provide different but related formulations of the error localizations by first partitioning a vector space into the channel error subspace and its orthogonal complement, the noise subspace. The locations of the errors are determined from either the error subspace eigenvectors or the noise subspace eigenvectors. We also present a brief performance analysis of the localization error in terms of the perturbation of the error subspace due to quantization.

To reduce the power consumption and circuit cost for mmWave systems, hybrid digital and analog (HDA) architecture is preferred in such a scenario. In this paper, an artificial noise (AN) aided secure HDA beamforming scheme is proposed for mmWave multiple input single output (MISO) system with low resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and finite-quantized phase shifters on radio frequency. The additive quantization noise model for AN aided HDA system is established to make an analysis of the secrecy performance of such systems. With the partial channel knowledge of eavesdropper available, an approximate expression of secrecy rate (SR) is derived. Then using this approximation formula, we propose a two-layer alternatively iterative structure (TLAIS) for optimizing digital precoder (DP) of confidential message (CM), digital AN projection matrix (DANPM) and analog precoder (AP). The inner-layer iteration loop is to design the DP of CMs and DANPM alternatively given a fixed matrix of AP. The outer-layer iteration loop is between digital baseband part and analog part, where the former refers to DP and DANPM, and the latter is AP. Then for a given digital part, we propose a gradient ascent algorithm to find the AP vector. Given a matrix of AP, we make use of general power iteration (GPI) method to compute DP and DANPM. This process is repeated until the terminal condition is reached. Simulation results show that the proposed TLAIS can achieve a better SR performance than existing methods, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio region.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933559","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771244,61472190,61702258,61501238,61602245); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789520","Hybrid digital and analog;mmWave;security;artificial noise;low-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC)","Phase shifters;Radio frequency;MIMO communication;Array signal processing;Quantization (signal);Security;Transmitters","digital-analogue conversion;millimetre wave communication;MISO communication;phase shifters;precoding;quantisation (signal);telecommunication security","analog precoder;mmWave systems;finite-quantized phase shifters;millimeter wave communication;ultra-wide new spectrum;ultra-high data transmission rate;power consumption;artificial noise;secure HDA beamforming scheme;mmWave multiple input single output system;resolution digital-to-analog converters;additive quantization noise model;aided HDA system;secrecy performance;partial channel knowledge;approximate expression;secrecy rate;approximation formula;two-layer alternatively iterative structure;digital precoder;digital AN projection matrix;DANPM;inner-layer iteration loop;outer-layer iteration loop;digital baseband part;general power iteration method;high signal-to-noise ratio region;secure hybrid digital precoder;low-resolution DAC","","3","","37","CCBY","6 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The focus is on a specific method of signal recovery that extends a procedure originally proposed by Plan and Vershynin for one-bit quantization to a multi-bit setting. At the heart of this paper is a characterization of the optimal trade-off between the number of measurements  $m$  and the bit depth per measurement  $b$  given a total budget of  $B = m \cdot b$  bits when the goal is to minimize the expected  $\ell _{2}$ -error in estimating the signal. It turns out that the choice  $b = 1$  is optimal for estimating the unit vector (direction) corresponding to the signal for any level of additive Gaussian noise before quantization as well as for a specific model of adversarial noise, whereas in a noiseless setting the choice  $b = 2$  is optimal for estimating the direction and the norm (scale) of the signal. Moreover, Lloyd–Max quantization is shown to be an optimal quantization scheme with respect to  $\ell _{2}$ -estimation error. Our analysis is corroborated by the numerical experiments showing nearly perfect agreement with our theoretical predictions. This paper is complemented by an empirical comparison to alternative methods of signal recovery. The results of that comparison point to a regime change depending on the noise level: in a low-noise setting, the approach under study falls short of more sophisticated competitors while being competitive in moderate- and high-noise settings.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2018.2826459","NSFBigdata-1419210; NSF-III-1360971; ONR-N00014-13-1-0764; AFOSRFA9550-13-1-0137; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8344517","Compressed sensing;Gaussian width;low-complexity signals;quantization","Quantization (signal);Noise level;Noise measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Additives;Gaussian noise;Compressed sensing","Gaussian noise;quantisation (signal);signal reconstruction","structured signal recovery;b-bit quantized linear measurements;high-dimensional structured signal;independent Gaussian linear measurements;multibit setting;adversarial noise;Lloyd-Max quantization;optimal quantization scheme;additive Gaussian noise;ℓ2-estimation error","","1","","51","IEEE","20 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In implementing the proposed strategy, the precoding design at each D2D transmitter is performed in such a way as to enhance the strength of the HP signal and minimize the interference caused at the UE by the D2D transmission. Furthermore, in accordance with the quantized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) information reported by the UE for the cellular downlink, each D2D transmitter selects the power allocation factor which maximizes the D2D transmission rate while simultaneously satisfying the outage probability constraint for the HP signal. Having chosen the precoding vectors and power allocation factor for each D2D connection, the D2D transmitter which achieves the maximum D2D transmission rate is selected in a distributed manner via opportunity carrier sensing.

We then use the complex version of the LLL lattice basis reduction (CLLL) algorithm to provide a reduced complexity suboptimal solution as well as an upper bound to the minimum distance of the lattice point from the line. Using this bound we are able to find a lower bound to the ergodic rate and a union bound estimate on the error performance of a lattice constellation used for lattice network coding.

Unfortunately, the bandwidth of the control channel by which the feedback is conveyed is often limited. An important issue is how to improve multi-user MIMO performance with minimal feedback. Conventional feedback techniques focus on improving the quantized codebook performance using various quantization criteria. In this paper, instead of trying to optimize a single codebook, we apply multiple alternating codebooks to effectively reduce the multi-user MIMO quantization error in addition to the reduction provided by the single codebook optimization techniques. That is, we use an existing quantization codebook design methodology to create not one but multiple such similar codebooks. The codebooks are alternated at each feedback instance creating a larger virtual codebook with the same number of feedback bits as the single smaller codebook. Simulation results show that significant performance gain in multi-user MIMO systems is obtained via the alternating codebook scheme.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2011.111011.110043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6092410","Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO);quantized channel;limited feedback","MIMO;Indexes;Quantization;Transmitters;Base stations;Vectors;Delay","MIMO communication;multi-access systems;optimisation;radio transmitters","multi-user MIMO;limited feedback;alternating codebooks;channel information;transmitter;quantized codebook;optimization","","9","","22","","29 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Standard methods include quantization of vectors or cloud simplification via octree structures. While a quantization into a bit representation will transform vectors in discrete positions, we added octree structures for a fixed level for re-indexing the quantized points relative to the individual local position of the subdivisions. Each subdivision multiplies the resolution of one coordinate by two, by adding a “virtual” bit. This bit can be then removed from the quantization bytes. So the combination of quantization and fixed octree structures decreases the amount of needed quantization bits without losing resolution. On the contrary, it is possible to increase the resolution of a PCD by adding the “virtual” bit to the quantized data without significantly changing the size of the dataset. We demonstrated the feasibility of this technique for the web by developing a lightweight framework, running in a browser-based environment.","2379-1780","978-1-5090-5743-6","10.1109/IC3D.2016.7823455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823455","Point cloud compression;vector quantization;space partitioning;octree coding;binary coding;point renderer;WebGL;JavaScript framework","Octrees;Quantization (signal);Three-dimensional displays;Encoding;Internet;Standards;Optimization","data visualisation;Internet;octrees;vector quantisation","3D point cloud compression framework;Web;point cloud dataset transmission;internet;vector quantization;octree structures;virtual bit representation;browser-based environment","","","","26","","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The movement of centroid as action advances yields a motion trajectory. The sequence of quantized orientations of trajectory segments are used as temporal features for action classification that uses probabilistic state models and maximum likelihood decision making strategy. The benchmark action datasets such as KTH dataset, Weizmann dataset and UIUC complex activity dataset are used to train and test state models of each action class.

For these reasons, Li-Ion batteries have earned considerable popularity, and they are widely used both in mobile computing devices (e.g. smartphones and smartwatches) and automotive systems (e.g. hybrid and electric vehicles). A fundamental parameter for battery health monitoring is the State of Health (SoH), which is computed from the maximum releasable capacity, and which represents battery functionality in energy storage and delivery. Among the most used data-driven approaches are Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF) regressions, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This article presents a comparison of different ML algorithms for estimating maximum releasable capacity of Li-Ion batteries, with a special focus on the implementation of both Forward and Recurrent ANNs (FNNs and RNNs, respectively), using prognostic Li-Ion battery data sets provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). After an evaluation of models performances in terms of RMSE and MAE, STM32Cube.AI tool was used to convert pre-trained ANNs to optimized ANSI C code for STM32 microcontrollers (MCUs), and to profile their complexity automatically. Finally, in order to decrease models size with minimal accuracy loss, the implemented ANNs were quantized via STM32Cube.AI, converting weights and activations from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integer precision.

For a MIMO channel which has multiple orthonormal vectors as channel spatial information, we exploit the geometrical structure of orthonormality while quantizing the spatial information matrix. The parameterization is of two types: one is in terms of a set of unit-norm vectors with different lengths, and the other is in terms of a minimal number of scalar parameters. These parameters are shown to be independent for the i.i.d. flat-fading Rayleigh channel, facilitating efficient quantization. In the first scheme, each of the unit-norm vectors is independently quantized with a finite number of bits using an optimal vector quantization (VQ) technique. Bit allocation is needed between the vectors, and the optimum bit allocation depends on the operating SNR of the system. In the second scheme, the scalar parameters are quantized. In slowly time-varying channels, the scalar parameters are also found to be smoothly changing over time, leading to the development of a simple quantization and feedback method using adaptive delta modulation.

The effects of analysis order and varying degrees of quantization in the spectral representation were also considered. Recognition experiments indicate that the performance of the weighted cepstral distance with vector quantized spectral data is considerably different from that previously reported for unquantized data. Comparison of recognition rates shows wide variations due to interaction of the distance measure with the analysis technique and with vector quantization.

Given a set of vectors observed as output of a chain of two transform coders, we identify both the transform and the quantizer of the first.

Image compression is performed in three steps. First, the image is decomposed at different scales, using the wavelet transform, to obtain an orthogonal wavelet representation of the image. Second, the wavelet coefficients are divided into vectors, which are projected onto a subspace using a neural network. The number of coefficients required to represent the vector in the subspace is less than the number of coefficients required to represent the original vector, resulting in data compression. Finally, the coefficients which project the vectors of wavelet coefficients onto the subspace are quantized and entropy coded. The advantages of various quantization schemes are discussed. Using these techniques, a 32 to 1 compression at peak SNR of 29 dB was obtained.<>","1520-6149","0-7803-0946-4","10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=319199","","Neural networks;Wavelet transforms;Image coding;Finite impulse response filter;Image reconstruction;Frequency;Discrete wavelet transforms;Wavelet coefficients;Low pass filters;Pixel","image coding;vector quantisation;wavelet transforms","vector quantization;image compression scheme;wavelet transform;neural networks;orthogonal wavelet representation;quantization schemes","","14","2","7","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PrecisionBatching is based on the following insights: 1) neural network inference with low batch sizes on traditional hardware architectures (e.g: GPUs) is memory bound, 2) activation precision is critical to improving quantized model quality and 3) matrix-vector multiplication can be decomposed into binary matrix-matrix multiplications, enabling quantized inference with higher precision activations at the cost of more arithmetic operations. Combining these three insights, PrecisionBatching enables inference at extreme quantization levels (< 8 bits) by shifting a memory bound problem to a compute bound problem and achieves higher compute efficiency and runtime speedup at fixed accuracy thresholds against standard quantized inference methods. Across a variety of applications (MNIST, language modeling, natural language inference, reinforcement learning) and neural network architectures (fully connected, RNN, LSTM), PrecisionBatching yields end-to-end speedups of over 8× on a GPU within a < 1 - 5% error margin of the full precision baseline, outperforming traditional 8-bit quantized inference by over 1.5 × - 2× at the same error tolerance.","","978-1-6654-4278-7","10.1109/PACT52795.2021.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9563027","neural network;quantization;performance;gpu","Recurrent neural networks;Runtime;Computational modeling;Natural languages;Graphics processing units;Reinforcement learning;Hardware","batch processing (computers);computer vision;graphics processing units;inference mechanisms;matrix algebra;matrix multiplication;natural language processing;neural net architecture;quantisation (signal);recurrent neural nets;reinforcement learning;storage management","precision batching;bitserial decomposition;neural network inference;GPU;quantized inference algorithm;matrix-vector multiplication;binary matrix-matrix multiplications;extreme quantization levels;memory bound problem;compute bound problem;standard quantized inference methods;language modeling;natural language inference;neural network architectures;MNIST;reinforcement learning;RNN;LSTM;fully connected","","","","41","","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a limited feedback system with RBD precoding, in which each receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI) and quantizes its channel. The transmitter receives the quantized CSI with a finite number of feedback bits from each receiver. In contrast to zero-forcing (ZF) or block diagonalization (BD) precoding, where the transmitter only requires the channel direction information which refers to the knowledge of subspaces spanned by the users' channel matrices, for RBD precoding the transmitter additionally requires the channel magnitude information which defines the strength of the eigenmodes of the users' channel matrices. The key contribution of our work is that we propose a new scheme for the channel quantization to supply the transmitter with both channel direction and magnitude information. Based on this new scheme, firstly, we investigate a random vector quantization (RVQ). We derive a bound for the throughput loss due to imperfect CSI and find a way to achieve the bound by linearly increasing the number of feedback bits with the system SNR. Secondly, we modify the LBG vector quantization algorithm to obtain a dominant eigenvector based LBG (DE- LBG) vector quantization which can significantly reduce the number of feedback bits compared to RVQ.

We approach this problem from a source coding perspective by formulating the quantized MISO system as a general vector quantization problem with encoder side information, constrained quantization space and non-mean-squared distortion function. By utilizing the high-resolution distortion analysis of the generalized quantizer, we obtain tight lower bounds of the capacity loss of a quantized MISO system with both optimal and mismatched channel quantizers.

Our method is motivated by the fact that the pattern of the notable events are similar and the learned models should be transferable to examine the events in other unlearned public scenes. To learn the patterns for an abnormal event, we divide the proposed method into two steps: feature coding and spatial pooling. For the feature coding step, the codebook is generated and the feature is quantized based on small patches. For the spatial pooling step, the patches are concatenating to exploit the spatial information of local regions. The intersection kernel is used to integrate with a SVM classifier.

The procedure exploits different relaxations for autoregressive and input parameters, based on the solution of a sequence of linear programming problems. The proposed technique is shown to provide tight bounds in some special cases.

Quantization is one of the go-to methods yielding state-of-the-art model compression. Most quantization approaches take a fully trained model, then apply different heuristics to determine the optimal bit-precision for different layers of the network, and finally retrain the network to regain any drop in accuracy. Based on Activation Density-the proportion of non-zero activations in a layer-we propose a novel in-training quantization method. Our method calculates optimal bit-width/precision for each layer during training yielding an energy-efficient mixed precision model with competitive accuracy. Since we train lower precision models progressively during training, our approach yields the final quantized model at lower training complexity and also eliminates the need for re-training. We run experiments on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImagenet on VGG19/ResNet18 architectures and report the accuracy and energy estimates for the same. We achieve up to 4.5× benefit in terms of estimated multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) reduction while reducing the training complexity by 50% in our experiments. To further evaluate the energy benefits of our proposed method, we develop a mixed-precision scalable Process In Memory (PIM) hardware accelerator platform. The hardware platform incorporates shift-add functionality for handling multibit precision neural network models. Evaluating the quantized models obtained with our proposed method on the PIM platform yields about 5× energy reduction compared to baseline 16-bit models. Additionally, we find that integrating activation density based quantization with activation density based pruning (both conducted during training) yields up to ~ 198× and ~44× energy reductions for VGG19 and ResNet18 architectures respectively on PIM platform compared to baseline 16-bit precision, unpruned models.","1558-1101","978-3-9819263-5-4","10.23919/DATE51398.2021.9474031","National Science Foundation, Amazon Research Award, and Technology Innovation Institute Abu Dhabi; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474031","neural networks;quantization;activation density;process in-memory","Training;Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Energy efficiency","data compression;embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;power aware computing;quantisation (signal);vector quantisation","mixed-precision quantization;energy efficient neural networks;neural networks gain widespread adoption;embedded devices;model compression techniques;seamless deployment;resource-constrained environments;state-of-the-art model compression;quantization approaches;fully trained model;optimal bit-precision;activation density;nonzero activations;in-training quantization method;energy-efficient mixed precision model;competitive accuracy;lower precision models;final quantized model;lower training complexity;CIFAR-100;energy estimates;estimated multiply-and-accumulate reduction;energy benefits;multibit precision neural network models;quantized models;PIM platform yields;energy reduction;baseline 16-bit models;integrating activation density;energy reductions;baseline 16-bit precision;unpruned models;memory hardware accelerator platform;mixed-precision scalable process","","1","","24","","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For our setting, Miyake-Muramatsu already proposed an asymptotically optimal LDPC coding scheme. In their scheme, a source sequence is first vector-quantized using an LDPC matrix and then it is compressed losslessly by fixed length coding with another LDPC matrix. However, it is not shown whether their scheme can attain good performance practically. This is mainly because of the difficulty of lossless coding by a fixed length code. In the proposed scheme, the lossless compression is performed by arithmetic coding instead of the fixed length code. Combined with vector-quantization using the reinforced belief propagation, the proposed scheme attains performance near the rate-distortion function practically with time complexity roughly equal to ${\bf O}(n\log n)$ for length $n$ source sequences.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2013.2288335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651840","Asymmetric sources;LDPC codes;lossy source coding;variable length coding","Encoding;Parity check codes;Rate-distortion;Decoding;Belief propagation;Probability distribution;Complexity theory","matrix algebra;parity check codes;rate distortion theory;source coding;variable length codes;vector quantisation","variable length lossy coding scheme;low density parity check code;lossy compression;general i.i.d. finite source;rate-distortion function;asymptotically optimal LDPC coding scheme;source sequence scheme;LDPC matrix;fixed length coding;arithmetic coding;vector-quantization;reinforced belief propagation","","8","","24","IEEE","1 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve superior video compression performance it is generally necessary to base the encoding decisions on a local scale, instead of the traditional frame-by-frame approach. Partitioning schemes for optimal frame subdivision have been proposed. Unfortunately, a full local approach that leads to inhomogeneous partitioning of the frame encounters the serious problem of dealing with an increase of side information, particularly in the area of very low bit-rate compression where a relatively large overhead can possibly erode the benefits of the local analysis. Our approach adopts a moderate position, which can still retain some of the advantages of variable block size while keeping the overhead to a bare minimum. The idea is to subdivide a frame in a fixed number of square panels that we call ""megablocks."" All decisions relative to intra (I) or inter (P) coding are made at the megablock level. These decisions pertain to motion block size and degree of error quantization in the P-mode as well as vector and scalar quantization of subbands in the I-mode. The key to the improved performance of the megablock partitioning scheme is the joint cost minimization of motion field and quantized error information. In very low bit rate video coding, the cost of transmitting motion vectors consumes a significant fraction of the total bit budget. The megablock structure permits the use of variable size motion blocks without incurring the cost associated with motion segmentation or a full quadtree approach.","1068-0314","0-8186-8406-2","10.1109/DCC.1998.672324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=672324","","Video coding;Costs;Quantization;Laboratories;Encoding;Video compression;Information analysis;Bit rate;Motion segmentation;Computer vision","prediction theory;video coding;data compression;vector quantisation;coding errors;quadtrees","control structure efficiency enhancement;predictive video coding;local scale;partitioning schemes;optimal frame subdivision;inhomogeneous partitioning;side information;very low bit-rate video compression;local analysis;variable block size;overhead;quadtree decomposition;intracoding;intercoding;motion block size;error quantization;vector quantization;scalar quantization;megablock partitioning;joint cost minimization","","1","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Good object proposal generation algorithms require high object detection recall rate as well as low computational cost, because generating object proposals is usually utilized as a preprocessing step. The problem of how to accelerate the object proposal generation and evaluation process without decreasing recall is thus of great interest. In this paper, we propose a new object proposal generation method using two-stage cascade support vector machines (SVMs), where in the first stage linear filters are learned for predefined quantized scales/aspect-ratios independently, and in the second stage a global linear classifier is learned across all the quantized scales/aspect-ratios for calibration, so that all the windows from the first stage can be compared properly. The windows with highest scores from the second stage are kept as inputs to our new efficient proposal calibration algorithm to improve their localization quality significantly, resulting in our final object proposals. We explain our scale/aspect-ratio quantization scheme, and investigate the effects of combinations of ℓ1 and ℓ2 regularizers in cascade SVMs with/without ranking constraints in learning.

"A high-rate chaotic secured covert channel based on multiple embedding in images","A.

Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) technique can be used to embed data in images to implement covert communication channels. In single embedding in QIM, each sample is quantized once to carry a single bit of the secret message. Double embedding in QIM was introduced by Sarkar and Manjunath in 2009, to increase the transferred data rate where a single sample is quantized twice to carry two bits in time. In this paper, a higher data transmission rate covert channel is developed using multiple embedding in the QIM framework with multi quantization vectors. This approach considers the embedding process as a communications problem, that it uses a structured scheme of Multiple Trellis-Coded Quantization jointed with Multiple Trellis-Coded Modulation (MTCQ/MTCM) to generate the stego-space. This technique returns a PSNR ≥ 40 dB. More over, increasing the coding states and/or the coding multiplicity returns an altered space with low correlated coefficients, thus improving the transferred data detection error rate performance. To secure the modulation process, the altered coefficients are chaotic scrambled by the 2-D Arnold Cat Map before embedding to increase the uncertainty in case of an attacker discovered the channel.","","978-1-4799-0080-0","10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707220","image communications;multiple trellis coded modulation;quantization index modulation;chaotic mapping","Vectors;Quantization (signal);Constellation diagram;Neurons;Data mining;Chaotic communication","image coding;steganography;trellis coded modulation;vector quantisation","high-rate chaotic secured covert channel;multiple embedding;secure communications;reliable security;quantization index modulation technique;double embedding;QIM framework;multi quantization vectors;multiple Trellis-coded quantization jointed;MTCQ;MTCM;multiple Trellis-coded modulation;stego-space;data detection error rate performance;2-D Arnold Cat map","","1","","25","","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a 3D mesh, the quantized 3D vertices are first partitioned into an octree structure. The octree is then traversed from the root and gradually to the leaves and, during the traversal, each 3D cell in the tree front is subdivided along three orthogonal directions. For each cell subdivision, an 8-bit bitpattern is generated, reordered, and entropy encoded. Furthermore, selective cell subdivision is performed to provide better rate-distortion performance, especially at low bitrates. It is shown in experimental results that the coding cost is around 5.5 bits per vertex (bpv) for 8-bit coordinate quantization and 16.6 bpv for 12-bit coordinate quantization on the average.

Bit-serial hardware takes advantage of the frugal nature of bit-serial computations that can operate on only as many bits as necessary. A bit-serial matrix multiplication consists of a summation of weighted binary matrix multiplications. In this work, we study the inherent locality of bit-serial matrix multiplications and propose a locality-aware scheduling algorithm that eliminates redundant data fetches from memory.

We design and analyze the performance of the associated variable-length quantizers (VLQs) and compare their performance with the previously studied fixed-length quantizers (FLQs). For the outage probability performance measure, we construct VLQs that can achieve the full-CSIT performance with finite rate. Moreover, as the signal-to-noise ratio P tends to infinity, we show that VLQs can achieve the full-CSIT outage probability performance with asymptotically zero feedback rate. For the SER performance measure, we show that while the SER with full-CSIT is not achievable at any finite feedback rate, the diversity and array gains with full-CSIT can be achieved using VLQs with asymptotically zero feedback rate as P → ∞. Our results show that VLQs can significantly improve upon the traditional FLQs that require infinite feedback rate to achieve the outage probability or the diversity and array gains with full-CSIT.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2014.2357811","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1218771); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6897978","Multiple antenna systems;limited feedback;channel quantization;variable-length quantization;beamforming;outage probability;error probability;diversity and array gains","Array signal processing;Encoding;Vectors;Transmitters;Receivers;Standards;Indexes","antenna arrays;array signal processing;diversity reception;error statistics;fading channels;quantisation (signal)","infinite feedback rate;asymptotically-zero feedback rate;diversity gain;array gain;finite feedback rate;SER performance measure;zero feedback rate;full-CSIT outage probability performance;signal-to-noise ratio;outage probability performance measure;FLQ;VLQ;fixed-length quantizers;variable-length quantizers;feedback binary codewords;quantized CSIT;quantized channel state information-transmitter;SER minimization;symbol error rate minimization;channel outage probability minimization;multiple-input single-output fading channel;multiple-antenna fading channels;variable-length limited feedback beamforming scheme","","14","","41","IEEE","12 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a WSN, sensors transmit their observations to a fusion center through a wireless medium where the observations are susceptible to unauthorized eavesdropping. Encryption approaches for WSNs with fixed threshold binary quantization were previously explored. However, fixed threshold binary quantization limits parameter estimation to scalar parameters. In this paper, we propose a stochastic encryption approach for WSNs that can operate on non-binary quantized observations and has the capability for vector parameter estimation. We extend a binary stochastic encryption approach proposed previously, to a non-binary generalized case. Sensor outputs are quantized using a quantizer with R + 1 levels, where R ϵ {1, 2, 3,...}, encrypted by flipping them with certain flipping probabilities, and then transmitted. Optimal estimators using maximum-likelihood estimation are derived for both a legitimate fusion center (LFC) and a third party fusion center (TPFC) perspectives. We assume the TPFC is unaware of the encryption. Asymptotic analysis of the estimators is performed by deriving the Cramer-Rao lower bound for LFC estimation, and the asymptotic bias and variance for TPFC estimation. Numerical results validating the asymptotic analysis are presented.","","978-1-5386-0504-2","10.1109/ICSGSC.2017.8038576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038576","Information security;sensor networks;low complexity encryption;secure estimation;stochastic encryption","Encryption;Maximum likelihood estimation;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Parameter estimation","cryptography;maximum likelihood estimation;mean square error methods;parameter estimation;probability;quantisation (signal);telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","LFC estimation;TPFC estimation;asymptotic analysis;low complexity encryption approach;Internet of Things;smart cities;smart grid;wireless sensor networks;WSN;wireless medium;encryption approaches;fixed threshold binary quantization limits parameter estimation;scalar parameters;nonbinary quantized observations;vector parameter estimation;binary stochastic encryption approach;nonbinary generalized case;sensor outputs;quantizer;optimal estimators;maximum-likelihood estimation;legitimate fusion center;party fusion center perspectives;WSN;encrypted nonbinary quantized data","","8","","10","","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this regard the host signal is first projected onto a random vector and transformed using a novel Logarithmic Quantization function. Then the transformed signal is quantized regarding the watermark data and the watermarked signal is obtained by applying inverse transform to the quantized signal. The perceptual model is further exploited to adjust the quantization step adaptively for watermark embedding.

This algorithm is deterministic and independent of initial conditions and does not impose any constraints on the number of transmit and receive antennas, the antenna correlation, or the fading statistics. Our simulation results for typical GSM/EDGE channels show that in general short FIR BFFs are sufficient to closely approach the performance of IIR BFFs even in severely frequency-selective channels.

With the derived probability distribution function (p.d.f.) of the predicted signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the DL data rate is then described by considering packet error rate (PER) caused by overestimated SNR. Finally the net throughput is maximized by optimizing the number of feedback bits and time interval.

In this work we take a perpendicular approach which draws inspiration from the expansive Private Information Retrieval literature. We view private inference as the task of retrieving an inner product of a parameter vector with the data, a fundamental step in most machine learning models.By combining binary arithmetic with real-valued one, we present a scheme which enables the retrieval of the inner product for models whose weights are either binarized, or given in fixed-point representation; such models gained increased attention recently, due to their ease of implementation and increased robustness. We also present a fundamental trade-off between the privacy of the user and that of the server, and show that our scheme is optimal in this sense.

Unfortunately, optimal performance requires either complete channel knowledge or knowledge of the optimal beamforming vector; both are hard to realize. In this article, a quantized maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beamforming technique is proposed where the receiver only sends the label of the best beamforming vector in a predetermined codebook to the transmitter. By using the distribution of the optimal beamforming vector in independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading matrix channels, the codebook design problem is solved and related to the problem of Grassmannian line packing. The proposed design criterion is flexible enough to allow for side constraints on the codebook vectors. Bounds on the codebook size are derived to guarantee full diversity order. Results on the density of Grassmannian line packings are derived and used to develop bounds on the codebook size given a capacity or SNR loss. Monte Carlo simulations are presented that compare the probability of error for different quantization strategies.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237152","","Array signal processing;MIMO;Diversity reception;Rayleigh channels;Transmitters;Feedback;Channel state information;Signal to noise ratio;Quantization;Resilience","array signal processing;MIMO systems;diversity reception;error statistics;Rayleigh channels;matrix algebra;codes;Monte Carlo methods;digital simulation","Grassmannian beamforming;multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems;MIMO wireless systems;transmit beamforming;receive combining;optimal performance;optimal beamforming vector;channel knowledge;quantized maximum signal-to-noise ratio;quantized maximum SNR beamforming;codebook;independent identically distributed fading channels;Rayleigh fading matrix channels;codebook design;Grassmannian line packing;codebook size bounds;SNR loss;Monte Carlo simulations;error probability","","1150","136","49","","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The nature of the problem is quantization of subspaces. It is well known that subspaces can be mathematically modeled as points in a Grassmann manifold. We model the variations between the dominant subspaces of channels at adjacent time instants to be along geodesics in the Grassmann manifold. Instead of quantizing the subspaces themselves, we propose to quantize the geodesic trajectory connecting two subspaces. More specifically, we quantize a key entity that characterizes a geodesic arc: the velocity matrix, which resembles angular speed in a one-dimensional complex space. Two techniques are proposed for quantizing the velocity matrix of the geodesic. In the first, a 1-bit feedback is utilized to indicate the preferred sign of a random velocity matrix of the geodesic. In the other, the velocity matrix is quantized using a Gaussian vector quantization codebook. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed 1-bit feedback algorithm is better than a previously proposed Grassmannian subspace packing scheme at low-to-medium Doppler frequencies and better than a gradient sign feedback scheme at all Doppler frequencies. In our simulations, the Gaussian vector quantization algorithm is always better than the 1-bit feedback algorithm.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2007.902598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4295237","Feedback;information rates;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems;quantization;time-varying channels","MIMO;Feedback;Transmitters;Vector quantization;Signal processing algorithms;Frequency;Covariance matrix;Time-varying channels;Channel capacity;Mathematical model","antenna arrays;differential geometry;feedback;Gaussian processes;MIMO communication;time-varying channels;vector quantisation","transmission subspace tracking;MIMO systems;low-rate feedback;time-varying channel;multiantenna communication systems;Grassmann manifold;geodesic trajectory;random velocity matrix;Gaussian vector quantization codebook;low-to-medium Doppler frequencies","","47","","35","","27 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the statistics of the channel, we derive the statistical precoder so that bounds of the error rate averaged over the random correlated channel are minimized. Due to statistical precoding, the distribution of the BA is highly nonuniform. Treating BA as a vector signal, we quantize it using vector quantization (VQ), which is known to be particularly useful for quantizing signals with nonuniform distributions. As the distribution of BA is taken into consideration in the codebook design, a good tradeoff between performance and feedback rate can be achieved. Simulations show that the combination of statistical precoding and VQ-based quantization for BA leads to good performance with a small number of feedback bits.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2011.2175011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6071016","Bit allocation;correlated channel;MIMO;precoding;VQ","Bit rate;Receivers;Bit error rate;Signal to noise ratio;Vectors;Matrix decomposition;MIMO","channel coding;correlation methods;MIMO communication;radio receivers;radio transmitters;statistical distributions;vector quantisation;wireless channels","bit allocation;statistical precoding;correlated MIMO channels;limited feedback;multiple-input multiple-output systems;MIMO transmitter;reverse link;MIMO receiver;random correlated channel;vector quantization;signal quantization;nonuniform distributions;codebook design;VQ-based quantization","","13","","36","IEEE","7 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system includes multiple base-stations cooperatively transmitting data to a pool of users, which share a rate-limited feedback channel for sending back the channel state information (CSI). The feedback mechanism is divided into two stages that are used separately for scheduling and beamforming. In the first stage, the users report their best channel gain from all the base-station antennas and the basestations schedule the best user for each of their antennas. The scheduled users are then polled in the second stage to feedback their quantized channel vectors. The paper proposes an analytical framework to derive the bit allocation between the two feedback stages and the bit allocation for quantizing each user's CSI. For a total number of feedback bits B, it is shown that the number of bits assigned to the second feedback stage should scale as log B. Furthermore, in quantizing channel vectors from different base-stations, each user should allocate its feedback budget in proportion to the logarithm of the corresponding channel gains. These bit allocation are then used to show that the overall system performance scales double-logarithmically with B and logarithmically with the transmit SNR. The paper further presents several numerical results to show that, in comparison with other beamforming-scheduling algorithms in the literature, the proposed scheme provides a consistent improvement in downlink sum rate and network utility. Such improvements, in particular, are achieved in spite of a significant reduction in the beamforming-scheduling computational complexity, which makes the proposed scheme an attractive solution for practical system implementations.","1938-1883","978-1-4577-2053-6","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364096","","Bit rate;Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Vectors;Downlink;Quantization;Array signal processing","antennas;array signal processing;channel allocation;cooperative communication;data communication;feedback;MIMO communication;scheduling;vector quantisation","beamforming algorithm;cooperative multipoint system;limited feedback CoMP system;cooperative data transmission;rate limited feedback channel;channel state information;channel gain;base station antenna;base station scheduling;channel vector quantization;bit allocation;CSI;bit assignment;network MIMO system","","6","","9","","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This results in an enhancement method that is integrated with parametric coders such as linear predictive analysis-by-synthesis coders. Second, we provide a scheme where the chosen vector is not restricted to be an element of the codebook. An interpolative search between the maximum likelihood estimate and its nearest neighbors in the codebook is used to improve the precision of the estimated parameters.

In particular, greedy scheduling with zeroforcing (ZF) precoding is considered for the doubly selective multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink channels. In limited feedback design, the discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM) is used as a fitting parametric model for capturing the time-variation of the doubly selective channels and reducing the number of the channel parameters. The resulting dimension reduction in the channel representation, in turn, translates into a reduced feedback load of channel state information (CSI). To exploit the considerable reduction in CSI feedback load, vector quantization (VQ) of DPS-BEM parameters is performed at users' receivers under the assumption that perfect BEM parameter estimation has been established by existing algorithms. The output indices of the quantized BEM parameter vectors are, then, sent to the base station (BS) via error-free limited feedback links. With the channel state information (CSI) at transmitter (CSIT), greedy scheduling and ZF precoding are deployed for multiuser transmission in each subcarrier of OFDM symbols in a LTE frame. Numerical results show that the ZF-based multiuser transmission scheme with the suggested BEM quantization and limited feedback design offers significant sum-rate gains and stable performance with high robustness against time-varying channels.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-6404-3","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501911","","Downlink;OFDM;Channel state information;Parametric statistics;State feedback;Vector quantization;Parameter estimation;Base stations;Output feedback;Transmitters","3G mobile communication;feedback;greedy algorithms;multiuser channels;OFDM modulation;precoding;time-frequency analysis;vector quantisation;wireless channels","limited feedback;scheduling;doubly selective multiuser;MISO downlink channels;3GPP-LTE systems;frequency-selective channels;time-selective channels;greedy scheduling;zero- forcing precoding;multiple input single output;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model;DPS-BEM;doubly selective channels;channel state information;CSI;vector quantization;BEM;multiuser transmission scheme","","1","2","16","","1 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computing beamforming vectors relies on quantized channel state information (CSI) feedback (limited feedback) from mobiles. Define the stability region for SDMA as the set of multiuser packet-arrival rates for which the steady-state queue lengths are finite. Given perfect feedback of channel-direction information (CDI) and equal power allocation over scheduled queues, the stability region is proved to be a convex polytope having the derived vertices. A similar result is obtained for the case with perfect feedback of CDI and channel-quality information (CQI), where CQI allows scheduling and power control for enlarging the stability region. For any set of arrival rates in the stability region, multiuser queues are shown to be stabilized by the joint queue-and-beamforming control policy that maximizes the departure-rate-weighted sum of queue lengths. The stability region for limited feedback is found to be the perfect-CSI region multiplied by one minus a small factor. The required number of feedback bits per mobile is proved to scale logarithmically with the inverse of the above factor as well as linearly with the number of transmit antennas minus one. The effect of limited feedback on queueing delay is also quantified. CDI quantization errors are shown to multiply average queueing delay by a factor M >; 1. For given M → 1, the number of feedback bits per mobile is proved to be O(-log2(1-1/M)) .","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2012.2209551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6243207","Adaptive arrays;cellular networks;downlink;feedback communications;interference suppression;queueing analysis","Multiaccess communication;Mobile communication;Array signal processing;Vectors;Stability criteria;Delay","array signal processing;interference suppression;mobile communication;queueing theory;space division multiple access;telecommunication traffic;transmitting antennas;wireless channels","zero-forcing SDMA delay;zero-forcing SDMA stability;limited feedback;queueing delay;space-division multiple access systems;zero-forcing beamforming;quantized channel state information feedback;quantized CSI feedback;multiuser packet-arrival rates;channel-direction information feedback;power allocation;scheduled queues;convex polytope;CDI feedback;channel-quality information feedback;CQI feedback;multiuser queues;queue-and-beamforming control policy;queue length departure-rate-weighted sum;perfect-CSI region;transmit antennas;CDI quantization errors;average queueing delay","","13","1","36","IEEE","18 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first present a finite blocklength achievability bound based on shape-gain quantization: the gain (amplitude) of the vector is compressed via scalar quantization, and the shape (the projection on the unit sphere) is quantized using a spherical code. The results are numerically evaluated, and they converge to the asymptotic values, as predicted by the error exponent. We then give a nonasymptotic lower bound on the performance of any compression scheme, and compare to the upper (achievability) bound. For a practical implementation of such a scheme, we use wrapped spherical codes, studied by Hamkins and Zeger, and use the Leech lattice as an example for an underlying lattice.

The entire feature space is quantized into non-overlapping regions, where each region is bounded by a number of hyperplanes. Each region is characterized by the occurrence of only a small number of the total alphabet of allophones (sub-phonetic speech units). By identifying the region in which a test feature vector lies, only the Gaussians that model the density of allophones that exist in that region need be evaluated. The quantization of the feature space is done in a hierarchical manner using a binary decision tree. Each node of the decision tree represents a region of the feature space, and is further characterized by a hyperplane (a vector v_/sub n/ and a scalar threshold value h/sub n/), that subdivides the region corresponding to the current node into two non-overlapping regions corresponding to the two children of the current node. Given a test feature vector, the process of finding the region that it lies in involves traversing this binary decision tree, which is computationally inexpensive. We present results of experiments that show that the Gaussian computation time can be reduced by as much as a factor of 20 with negligible degradation in accuracy.

The KLT estimate is derived purely from quantized data, so the decoder can track the encoder state without any side information. The effect of estimating only from quantized data is quantitatively analyzed. Two convergence results which hold in the absence of estimation noise are presented. The first applies for any vector dimension but does not preclude the necessity of a sequence of quantization step sizes that goes to zero. The second applies only in the two-dimensional case, but shows local convergence for a fixed, sufficiently small quantization step size.

In this study, we consider a mmWave MIMO-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver with a generalized hybrid architecture in which a small number of radio frequency (RF) chains and low-resolution ADCs are employed simultaneously. Owing to the strong nonlinearity introduced by low-resolution ADCs, the task of data detection is challenging, particularly achieving a Bayesian optimal data detection. This study aims to fill this gap. By using a generalized expectation consistent signal recovery technique, we propose a computationally efficient data detection algorithm that provides a minimum mean-square error estimate on data symbols and is extended to a mixed-ADC architecture. Considering particular structure of MIMO-OFDM channel matrix, we provide a low-complexity realization in which only fast fourier transform (FFT) operation and matrix-vector multiplications are required. Furthermore, we present an analytical framework to study the theoretical performance of the detector in the large-system limit, which can precisely evaluate the performance expressions, such as mean-square error and symbol error rate. Based on this optimal detector, the potential of adding a few low-resolution RF chains and high-resolution ADCs for a mixed-ADC architecture is investigated. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and can be used for system design rapidly.

In particular, the application of limited-feedback strategies for the optimal power allocation in distributed estimation is studied. In order to find the BLUE estimator of the unknown parameter, the FC combines spatially distributed, linearly processed, noisy observations of local sensors received through orthogonal channels corrupted by fading and additive Gaussian noise. Most optimal power-allocation schemes proposed in the literature require the feedback of the exact instantaneous channel state information from the FC to local sensors. This paper proposes a limited-feedback strategy in which the FC designs an optimal codebook containing the optimal power-allocation vectors, in an iterative offline process, based on the generalized Lloyd algorithm with modified distortion functions. Upon observing a realization of the channel vector, the FC finds the closest codeword to its corresponding optimal power-allocation vector and broadcasts the index of the codeword. Each sensor will then transmit its analog observations using its optimal quantized amplification gain. This approach eliminates the requirement for infinite-rate digital feedback links and is scalable, especially in large WSNs.","1058-6393","978-1-4799-2390-8","10.1109/ACSSC.2013.6810338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810338","Limited feedback;best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE);generalized Lloyd algorithm;power allocation;distributed estimation;fusion center;wireless sensor networks","Sensors;Vectors;Fading;Estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Channel estimation;Algorithm design and analysis","AWGN;encoding;estimation theory;fading channels;resource allocation;wireless sensor networks","channel aware power allocation;linear distributed estimation;limited feedback;distributed best linear unbiased estimation;random parameter;fusion center;wireless sensor network;WSN;optimal power allocation;orthogonal channels;fading channels;additive Gaussian noise;optimal codebook;optimal power-allocation vectors;iterative offline process;generalized Lloyd algorithm;quantized amplification;infinite-rate digital feedback links","","7","","8","","8 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This scheme is capable of exploiting simultaneously both the spectrally and spatially localized characteristics of the high frequency subbands. A multi-modal Laplacian distribution is used to model the spectral distribution of a high frequency subband and a Gibbs random field is employed to model the spatial constraints. The modeling is incorporated into a non-iterative MAP estimation to yield the quantized subbands. This quantization scheme reduces significantly the activities in the high frequency bands while preserving the perceptually important structures.

In this context, we illustrate that the LMMSE detector performs slightly better than the SVD detector. We also study precoder extrapolation, when the precoder is only fed back at a limited number of time instances, as well as a related detector extrapolation scheme for the LMMSE and SVD detector, when the channel is only known at some specific time instances. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed extrapolation methods.","2219-5491","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7071732","","Detectors;Extrapolation;Vectors;Receivers;Quantization (signal);Channel estimation;Multiplexing","least mean squares methods;precoding;quantisation (signal);singular value decomposition;space division multiplexing;time-varying channels","time-varying channels;limited feedback;combining spatial multiplexing;linear unitary pre-coding;high data rates;quantized channel feedback;modified precoder quantization approach;linear minimum mean square error detector;LMMSE detector;SVD detector","","","","11","","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional cooperation techniques require sharing large amounts of information over finite-capacity backhaul links and assume that base stations have full channel state information (CSI) of all the active users in the system. In this paper, a new limited feedback strategy is proposed for multicell beamforming where cooperation is restricted to sharing only the CSI of active users among base stations. The system setup considered is a linear array of cells based on the “soft hand-off model,” where each cell contains single-antenna users and multi-antenna base stations. Beamforming vectors are designed using a generalized eigenvector approach to maximize the sum-rate in a single-interferer scenario, at high signal to noise ratio. Users are assumed to feedback quantized CSI of the desired and interfering channels using a finite-bandwidth feedback link. An upper bound on the mean loss in sum rate due to random vector quantization is derived. A new feedback-bit allocation strategy, to partition the available bits between the desired and interfering channels, is developed to reduce the mean loss in sum-rate due to quantization for the soft hand-off model. The proposed feedback-bit partitioning algorithm is shown, using simulations, to yield sum-rates close to the those obtained using full CSI at base station.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2090346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613944","Base station cooperation;feedback-bit partitioning;limited feedback","Base stations;Array signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;Upper bound;Encoding;Partitioning algorithms;Materials","array signal processing;vector quantisation","adaptive limited feedback;sum-rate maximizing beamforming;cooperative multicell systems;base station cooperation;cellular systems;finite-capacity backhaul links;channel state information;multicell beamforming;soft hand-off model;multi-antenna base stations;feedback quantized CSI;interfering channels;finite-bandwidth feedback link;random vector quantization;feedback-bit allocation strategy","","134","6","43","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this system, a low-complexity yet near-optimal greedy algorithm is developed for the design of the hybrid analog/digital precoders.

In quantitative and qualitative experiments, L-Verse shows impressive results against previous methods in both image-to-text and text-to-image generation on MS-COCO Captions.

The (infinite) set of all possible movelets is quantized into codewords obtained by the vector quantization. For every pair of frames each codeword is assigned a probability. Recognition is performed by simultaneously estimating the most likely sequence of codewords and the action that took place in a sequence. This is done using hidden Markov models.

It makes existing image coding standards inefficient on compressing them. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel coding scheme based on the H.264 intra-frame coding. Two new intra modes are proposed to better exploit spatial correlations in compound images. The first is residual scalar quantization (RSQ) mode, where intra-predicted residues are directly quantized and entropy coded. The second is base colors and index map (BCIM) mode that can be viewed as an adaptive vector quantization. In this mode, an image block is represented by several representative colors, called as base colors, and an index map to compress. Two new modes as well as previous intra modes in H.264 are selected by the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) method in each block. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme not only improves the coding efficiency even more than 10 dB for compound images but also keeps the similar performance as H.264 for natural images.","2158-1525","978-1-4244-3827-3","10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5118388","","Image coding;MPEG 4 Standard;Automatic voltage control;Graphics;Image segmentation;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Transform coding;Asia;Quantization;Entropy","data compression;entropy codes;vector quantisation;video coding","compress compound image;H.264/MPEG-4 AVC;spatial correlation;image coding standard;intra-frame coding;residual scalar quantization mode;entropy code;base color and index map mode;adaptive vector quantization;rate-distortion optimization method","","9","","14","","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The polynomial coefficients are quantized in closed-loop by a split vector quantizer. For the transient speech, the unvoiced part is modeled by an 8/sup th/-order all-pole model while the voiced part is modeled by the low-frequency harmonic components. The transitional behavior is characterized by the onset time and growth rate of each harmonic component.

The highband excitation is synthesized using a sinusoidal model whose parameters are determined directly from the decoded narrowband speech. The highband spectral envelope and gain are vector quantized in a manner which exploits information from the decoded narrowband speech.

The purpose is to develop models of the perception of wideband audio signals in the wavelet domain. The coefficients in the wavelet subbands are quantized using a scheme that adapts to the subband signal by setting the quantization step size for a particular subband to a size that is inversely proportional to the subband energy, and then, within a subband, by modifying the energy determined step size as inversely proportional to the amplitude probability density of the coefficient. The amplitude probability density of the coefficients in each subband is modelled using learned vector/scalar quantization employing frequency sensitive competitive learning. The source data consists of 1-channel, 16-bit linear data sampled at 44.1 kHz from a CD containing major classical and pop music. Preliminary results show a bit-rate of 150 kbps, rather than 705.6 kbps, with no perceptual loss in quality.

Finally, it quantizes the prediction error in each class using a vector quantizer. The original image set is described by the segmentation map, the model parameters for each class, and the quantized prediction errors. The SLPC method can produce very high compression gains, because the specification of the segmentation map and model parameters requires significantly fewer bits than that for the original intensity values. This method has been applied to magnetic resonance head images with three spectral bands (one T1 weighted and two T2 weighted, 256/spl times/256/spl times/12 bits/image).

In addition, sGLOH can reject incongruous correspondences by adding a global constraint on the rotations either as an a priori knowledge or based on the data. This paper thoroughly reconsiders sGLOH and improves it in terms of robustness, speed and descriptor dimension. The revised sGLOH embeds more quantized rotations, thus yielding more correct matches. A novel fast matching scheme is also designed, which significantly reduces both computation time and memory usage. In addition, a new binarization technique based on comparisons inside each descriptor histogram is defined, yielding a more compact, faster, yet robust alternative.

This paper develops message-passing de-quantization (MPDQ) algorithms for minimum mean-squared error estimation of a random vector from quantized linear measurements, notably allowing the linear expansion to be overcomplete or undercomplete and the scalar quantization to be regular or non-regular. The algorithm is based on generalized approximate message passing (GAMP), a recently-developed Gaussian approximation of loopy belief propagation for estimation with linear transforms and nonlinear componentwise-separable output channels. For MPDQ, scalar quantization of measurements is incorporated into the output channel formalism, leading to the first tractable and effective method for high-dimensional estimation problems involving non-regular scalar quantization. The algorithm is computationally simple and can incorporate arbitrary separable priors on the input vector including sparsity-inducing priors that arise in the context of compressed sensing. Moreover, under the assumption of a Gaussian measurement matrix with i.i.d. entries, the asymptotic error performance of MPDQ can be accurately predicted and tracked through a simple set of scalar state evolution equations. We additionally use state evolution to design MSE-optimal scalar quantizers for MPDQ signal reconstruction and empirically demonstrate the superior error performance of the resulting quantizers. In particular, our results show that non-regular quantization can greatly improve rate-distortion performance in some problems with oversampling or with undersampling combined with a sparsity-inducing prior.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2217334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295675","Analog-to-digital conversion;approximate message passing;belief propagation;compressed sensing;frames;non-regular quantizers;overcomplete representations;quantization;Slepian-Wolf coding;Wyner-Ziv coding","Quantization;Estimation;Linear systems;Transforms;Compressed sensing;Approximation algorithms;AC-DC converters","approximation theory;belief networks;compressed sensing;Gaussian processes;mean square error methods;measurement systems;message passing;quantisation (signal)","compressed sensing;quantized linear measurement;vector estimation;simple linear techniques;message-passing dequantization algorithms;MPDQ algorithms;minimum mean-squared error estimation;random vector;linear expansion;scalar quantization;generalized approximate message passing;GAMP;Gaussian approximation;loopy belief propagation;linear transforms;nonlinear componentwise-separable output channels;measurements scalar quantization;output channel formalism;high-dimensional estimation problems;nonregular scalar quantization;incorporate arbitrary separable priors;sparsity-inducing priors;Gaussian measurement matrix;asymptotic error performance;scalar state evolution equations;MSE-optimal scalar quantizers;MPDQ signal reconstruction;sparsity-inducing prior","","75","2","58","IEEE","5 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One simplification is to abandon the likeness to the method of instrumental variables (IV), where the ""instrumental variable"" is the quantized state vector, and introduce more quantization.

In order to scale informed transmitter schemes to emerging massive MIMO systems with a large number of transmit antennas at the base station, one common approach is to employ time division duplexing (TDD) and to exploit the implicit feedback obtained from channel reciprocity. However, most existing cellular deployments are based on frequency division duplexing (FDD), hence it is of great interest to explore backwards compatible massive MIMO upgrades of such systems. For a fixed feedback rate per antenna, the number of codewords for quantizing the channel grows exponentially with the number of antennas, hence generating feedback based on look-up from a standard vector quantized codebook does not scale. In this paper, we propose noncoherent trellis-coded quantization (NTCQ), whose encoding complexity scales linearly with the number of antennas. The approach exploits the duality between source encoding in a Grassmannian manifold (for finding a vector in the codebook which maximizes beamforming gain) and noncoherent sequence detection (for maximum likelihood decoding subject to uncertainty in the channel gain). Furthermore, since noncoherent detection can be realized near-optimally using a bank of coherent detectors, we obtain a low-complexity implementation of NTCQ encoding using an off-the-shelf Viterbi algorithm applied to standard trellis coded quantization. We also develop advanced NTCQ schemes which utilize various channel properties such as temporal/spatial correlations. Monte Carlo simulation results show the proposed NTCQ and its extensions can achieve near-optimal performance with moderate complexity and feedback overhead.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2013.111413.130379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6678040","Massive MIMO systems;limited feedback;trellis-coded quantization (TCQ);noncoherent TCQ","Quantization (signal);MIMO;Array signal processing;Vectors;Transmitting antennas;Antenna feeds;Encoding","antenna arrays;array signal processing;cellular radio;frequency division multiplexing;maximum likelihood decoding;MIMO communication;Monte Carlo methods;source coding;time division multiplexing;transmitting antennas;trellis codes","noncoherent trellis coded quantization;practical limited feedback technique;massive MIMO systems;channel state information accuracy;CSI accuracy;beamforming gain;single-user multiple-input multiple-output wireless communication system;SU MIMO wireless communication system;multiplexing gain;multiuser MIMO wireless communication system;MU MIMO wireless communication system;limited feedback scheme;pre-defined codebook;channel quantization;transmit antennas;feedback overhead;informed transmitter scheme;base station;time division duplexing;TDD;implicit feedback;channel reciprocity;cellular deployment;frequency division duplexing;FDD;standard vector quantized codebook;encoding complexity;source encoding;Grassmannian manifold;noncoherent sequence detection;maximum likelihood decoding;channel gain;noncoherent detection;coherent detectors;low-complexity implementation;NTCQ encoding;off-the-shelf Viterbi algorithm;standard trellis-coded quantization;advanced NTCQ scheme;channel properties;temporal-spatial correlations;Monte Carlo simulation;near-optimal performance","","115","6","45","","2 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More formally, the decision task of the transmitter is to maximize a utility function f(x;g) with respect to x (e.g., a power allocation vector) given the knowledge of a quantized version of the function parameters g. We exhibit a special case of an energy-efficient power control (PC) problem for which the optimal task oriented CSI quantizer (TOCQ) can be found analytically.

We assume that time evolution of MIMO channels is modeled as a Gauss-Markov process parameterized by a temporal-correlation coefficient. Since feedback rate is usually low, we assume rank-one transmit beamforming or transmission with single data stream. For given feedback rate, we analyze the optimal feedback interval that maximizes the average received power of the systems with two transmit or two receive antennas. For other system sizes, the optimal feedback interval is approximated by maximizing the rate difference in a large system limit. Numerical results show that the large system approximation can predict the optimal interval for finite-size system quite accurately. Numerical results also show that quantizing transmit beamforming with the optimal feedback interval gives larger rate than the existing Kalman-filter scheme does by as much as 10% and then feeding back for every block does by 44% when the number of feedback bits is small.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2821126","Kasetsart University(grant numbers:59/02/EE); Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328874","MIMO;transmit beamforming;temporally correlated channels;Gauss-Markov process;finite-rate feedback;random vector quantization (RVQ);feedback interval","Array signal processing;Transmitters;Receiving antennas;MIMO communication;Fading channels;Channel estimation","array signal processing;feedback;Markov processes;MIMO communication;receiving antennas;wireless channels","optimizing feedback interval;temporally correlated MIMO channels;finite-rate feedback;perfect channel state information;point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output channel;transmission rate;quantized transmit beamforming vector;rate-limited feedback channel;temporal-correlation coefficient;optimal feedback interval;rate difference;feedback bits;frequency-division duplex;Gauss-Markov process","","7","","33","IEEE","30 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sinusoidal modeling of the speech linear prediction (LP) residual is performed within the general framework of matching pursuits with a dictionary of sinusoids. The frequency space of sinusoids is restricted to sets of frequency intervals or bins, which in conjunction with the closed-loop analysis allow us to map the frequencies of the sinusoids into a frequency vector that is efficiently quantized. In voiced frames, two sets of frequency vectors are generated: one of them represents harmonically related and the other one nonharmonically related components of the voiced segment. This approach eliminates the need for voicing dependent cutoff frequency that is difficult to estimate correctly and to quantize at low bit rates. In transition frames, to efficiently extract and quantize the set of frequencies needed for the sinusoidal representation of the LP residual, we introduce frequency bin vector quantization (FBVQ). FBVQ selects a vector of nonuniformly spaced frequencies from a frequency codebook in order to represent the frequency domain information in transition regions. Our use of FBVQ with closed-loop searching contribute to an improvement of speech quality in transition frames. The effectiveness of the coding scheme is enhanced by exploiting the critical band concept of auditory perception in defining the frequency bins. To demonstrate the viability and the advantages of the new models studied, we designed a 4 kbps matching pursuits sinusoidal speech coder.

The problem is especially important for high-dimensional and large-scale data. Recently, many techniques encoding high-dimensional data to compact codes have been proposed. The product quantization and its variations that encode the cluster index in each subspace have been shown to provide impressive accuracy. In this paper, we explore a simple question: is it best to use all the bit-budget for encoding a cluster index? We have found that as data points are located farther away from the cluster centers, the error of estimated distance becomes larger. To address this issue, we propose a novel compact code representation that encodes both the cluster index and quantized distance between a point and its cluster center in each subspace by distributing the bit-budget. We also propose two distance estimators tailored to our representation. We further extend our method to encode global residual distances in the original space. We have evaluated our proposed methods on benchmarks consisting of GIST, VLAD, and CNN features. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed methods significantly and consistently improve the search accuracy over other tested techniques.

In this paper, we study quantization of high-dimensional inputs, aiming at improving performance under resolution constraints by accounting for the system task in the quantizers design. We focus on the task of recovering a desired signal statistically related to the high-dimensional input, and analyze two quantization approaches. We, first, consider vector quantization, which is typically computationally infeasible, and characterize the optimal performance achievable with this approach. Next, we focus on practical systems that utilize hardware-limited scalar uniform analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and design a task-based quantizer under this model. The resulting system accounts for the task by linearly combining the observed signal into a lower dimension prior to quantization. We then apply our proposed technique to channel estimation in massive MIMO networks.

Our results are asymptotic as the number of transmit and receive antennas increases with fixed ratio, for a fixed number of feedback bits per dimension. Numerical results show that given a target spectral efficiency, the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched filter can require significantly more feedback.

Comparisons to the Split-VQ, the Multi-Stage VQ, the Trellis Coded Quantization, the interframe Block-Based Trellis Quantizer, and the interframe scheme used in IS-641 EFRC and the GSM AMR codec are provided. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed lattice-based quantization schemes, while maintaining a very low complexity.

This paper describes S[arsa]LVQ, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm and shows its feasibility for Go. As the distributed LVQ representation corresponds to a (quantized) codebook of compressed and generalized pattern templates, the state space requirements for online reinforcement methods are significantly reduced, thus decreasing the complexity of the decision space and consequently improving the play performance. As a result of competitive learning, SLVQ can win against heuristic players and starts to level off against stronger opponents such as Wally. SLVQ outperforms S[arsa]Linear when playing against both a heuristic player and Wally.

The spectral coefficients are quantized by using a memoryless split vector quantization (VQ) approach that does not use frame correlation. Considering that excitation signals of a specific speaker show low intra-variation especially in the voiced regions, the conventional adaptive codebook for pitch prediction is replaced by a speaker-dependent pitch-pulse codebook trained by a corpus of single-speaker speech signals. To further improve the coding efficiency, the proposed coder flexibly combines nonpredictive and predictive type method considering the structure of the TTS system. By applying the proposed algorithm to a Korean TTS system, we could obtain comparable quality to the G.729 speech coder and satisfy all the requirements that TTS system needs.

In the limited feedback system presented, the desired and interfering CSI is quantized by the users and fed back to the base stations over a finite-bandwidth link. Each receiver is assumed to use two separate codebooks to quantize the desired and interfering channels. It is proposed to vary the codebook sizes adaptively as a function of the relative strength of the channels to minimize the loss in sum-rate. To this end, the mean loss in sum-rate due to random vector quantization is quantified. Closed-form expressions are derived to partition the available feedback bits adaptively between the desired and interfering channels to minimize the mean loss in sum-rate.

Firstly, we resize the input window to different quantized sizes (e.g. 8 × 8) and calculate the normed gradients of each resized image. Then according to the different gradient model of the object and background in the fixed window, we can quickly and accurately locate the target object.

Based on random vector quantization of the channel vectors, we obtain analytical approximations of the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) of each legitimate receiver (LR) and the ergodic secrecy sum rate of the system with arbitrary system parameters. Based on the obtained analytical results, the near-optimal power allocation to the information signals and AN can be obtained using a numerical method. We show using an information-theoretical method that, besides the advantage in the ESR over the linear precoding scheme, THP can reduce the supported rate of the eavesdropper’s channel by preventing the eavesdropper from obtaining the legitimate channels’ (quantized) CSI. The ESR loss of each LR compared with the perfect CSI case will increase without bound for a fixed number of feedback bits. We also derive a feedback bit scaling law to solve this problem.

We develop a novel complexity-constrained distributed variable-rate quantized CS method, which minimizes a weighted sum between the mean square error signal reconstruction distortion and the average encoding rate. The encoding complexity of each sensor is restrained by pre-quantizing the encoder input, i.e., the CS measurements, via vector quantization. Following the entropy-constrained design, each encoder is modeled as a quantizer followed by a lossless entropy encoder, and variable-rate coding is incorporated via rate measures of an entropy bound. For a two-sensor system, necessary optimality conditions are derived, practical training algorithms are proposed, and complexity analysis is provided.

However, the trade-off between the quantization bitwidth and final accuracy is complex and non-convex, which makes it difficult to be optimized directly. Minimizing direct quantization loss (DQL) of the coefficient data is an effective local optimization method, but previous works often neglect the accurate control of the DQL, resulting in a higher loss of the final DNN model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, called Vector Loss. Using this new metric, we decompose the minimization of the DQL to two independent optimization processes, which significantly outperform the traditional iterative L2 loss minimization process in terms of effectiveness, quantization loss as well as final DNN accuracy. We also develop a new DNN quantization solution called VecQ, which provides minimal direct quantization loss and achieve higher model accuracy. In order to speed up the proposed quantization process during model training, we accelerate the quantization process with a parameterized probability estimation method and template-based derivation calculation. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, IMDB movie review and THUCNews text data sets with numerical DNN models. The results demonstrate that our proposed quantization solution is more accurate and effective than the state-of-the-art approaches yet with more flexible bitwidth support.

While typical content-based image retrieval systems operate in some parameter space, the introduced data-driven technique uses as features the very image data, represented as sets of recurring patterns collected in dictionaries. In a first offline step, the images are quantized in the Hue Saturation Value space and converted into strings, after being modified to preserve some vertical information in the process, and representative dictionaries are extracted from each string with a data compression algorithm; subsequently, the dictionaries are matched in pairs and the distance between each couple of them is estimated. On the basis of the computed distances, the system enables the user to retrieve images with similar content to a given query image. Compression-based classification techniques, being data-driven, have the drawback of being computationally intensive and have been applied, in the general case, to restricted datasets; instead, the low-complexity solutions employed in this work allow applying this similarity measure on larger datasets, keeping at the same time the desirable parameter-free approach which is characteristic of these methods. Experiments show that the proposed technique outperforms similar recent concepts based on Vector Quantization.","","978-1-4244-6872-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447135","Compression;similarity measure;information retrieval;vector quantization;pattern matching","Image retrieval;Image coding;Dictionaries;Information retrieval;Data compression;Content based retrieval;Color;Image converters;Data mining;Time measurement","content-based retrieval;data compression;image classification;image coding;image colour analysis;image retrieval;vector quantisation","image retrieval;compression based techniques;color images;hue saturation value space;data compression algorithm;classification techniques;vector quantization","","2","","26","","15 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this case, the artificial noise (AN) leaks to the legitimate receiver due to CSI quantization. In the literature, all quantization bits are used to quantize the beamforming vector. Then the null space of this quantized beamforming vector is used to transmit the AN. We find that such quantization schemes can result in serious interference at the legitimate receiver. To overcome this issue, we propose that the beamforming vector and the AN vector should be quantized separately, where the beamforming vector should be selected from a codebook to maximize the beamforming gain and the AN vector should be selected from another codebook to minimize the leakage (or interference). Theoretical results show that separate quantization can significantly reduce the AN leakage at the legitimate receiver. Furthermore, based on the proposed quantization scheme, we show how to allocate bits to separately quantize the beamforming vector and the AN vector to maximize the secrecy rate. By using the proposed quantization and bit allocation schemes, the secrecy rates of masked beamforming systems can be improved compared to the conventional quantization schemes.

Since the learned representation is tuned to contain only phonetic content, we resort to using a high capacity WaveNet decoder to infer information discarded by the encoder from previous samples. Moreover, the behavior of autoencoder models depends on the kind of constraint that is applied to the latent representation. We compare three variants: a simple dimensionality reduction bottleneck, a Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and a discrete Vector Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE). We analyze the quality of learned representations in terms of speaker independence, the ability to predict phonetic content, and the ability to accurately reconstruct individual spectrogram frames. Moreover, for discrete encodings extracted using the VQ-VAE, we measure the ease of mapping them to phonemes.

We present a private face verification system that can be executed in the server without interaction, working with encrypted feature vectors for both the templates and the probe face. We achieve this by combining two significant contributions: 1) a novel feature model for Gabor coefficients' magnitude driving a Lloyd-Max quantizer, used for reducing plaintext cardinality with no impact on performance; 2) an extension of a quasi-fully homomorphic encryption able to compute, without interaction, the soft scores of an SVM operating on quantized and encrypted parameters, features and templates.

The terminals are then allowed to communicate with each other, possibly interactively in many rounds and without rate restrictions, over a noiseless two-way public channel. Randomization is permitted at each terminal. The goal is for the terminals to generate a SK comprising discrete common randomness which is concealed from an eavesdropper that has access to the public interterminal communication. We establish that this maximum rate of SK generation, i.e., SK capacity, is, as expected, the per-symbol mutual information I of the correlated sources. Our main technical contribution is a new scheme for achieving SK capacity using structured codes. In our scheme, vector quantization at rate R nats/source symbol of the source at terminal 1 is performed by employing nested lattice codes with dithering. Then, a SK is generated by the terminals from the quantized random sequence at terminal 1 and the (unquantized) Gaussian source at terminal 2, using both lossy and lossless data compression techniques. Our algorithm, using a rate-R lattice quantizer, achieves a maximum SK rate of 1/2 log 1/(e-2I+(1-e-2I)e-2R), which tends to the SK capacity I with increasing R. Thus, our result also specifies the associated tradeoff between quantization rate R and the maximum achievable SK rate. This tradeoff is shown to be optimum among a certain restricted class of schemes for SK generation that involve quantization at rate R of a Gaussian source at one terminal.","2157-8117","978-1-4244-2256-2","10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595077","","Lattices;Quantization;Mutual information;Chromium;Indexes;Lead;Data compression","cryptography;Gaussian processes;random processes;source coding;vector quantisation","secret key generation;correlated Gaussian sources;randomization;SK capacity;per-symbol mutual information;structured codes;vector quantization;lattice codes;quantized random sequence;rate-R lattice quantizer;quantization","","9","","11","","8 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To produce a feature representation that is independent of segment length, we utilize a set of ngram features based on vector-quantized representations of the acoustic input.

To perform deviation detection well requires methods that, given only ""normal"" data from a distribution of unknown parametric form, can produce a reliable statistic for rejecting the null hypothesis, i.e. evidence for devating data. One measure of the strength of this evidence based on the data is the p-value, but few deviation detection methods utilize p-value estimation. We compare three methods that can be used to produce p-values: one class support vector machine (OCSVM), conformal anomaly detection (CAD), and a simple ""most central pattern"" (MCP) algorithm. The SVM and the CAD method should be able to handle a distribution of any shape. The methods are evaluated on synthetic data sets to test and illustrate their strengths and weaknesses, and on data from a real life self-monitoring scenario with a city bus fleet in normal traffic. The OCSVM has a Gaussian kernel for the synthetic data and a Hellinger kernel for the empirical data. The MCP method uses the Mahalanobis metric for the synthetic data and the Hellinger metric for the empirical data. The CAD uses the same metrics as the MCP method and has a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) non-conformity measure for both sets. The conclusion is that all three methods give reasonable, and quite similar, results on the real life data set but that they have clear strengths and weaknesses on the synthetic data sets. The MCP algorithm is quick and accurate when the ""normal"" data distribution is unimodal and symmetric (with the chosen metric) but not otherwise. The OCSVM is a bit cumbersome to use to create (quantized) p-values but is accurate and reliable when the data distribution is multimodal and asymmetric. The CAD is also accurate for multimodal and asymmetric distributions. The experiment on the vehicle data illustrate how algorithms like these can be used in a self-monitoring system that uses a fleet of vehicles to conduct deviation detection without supervision and without prior knowledge about what is being monitored.","1949-3681","978-1-4799-5367-7","10.1109/SASO.2014.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001005","","Training;Kernel;Vehicles;Conferences;Histograms;Design automation;Measurement","fault tolerant computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software reliability;support vector machines;system monitoring","p-values estimation;self-monitoring system;null hypothesis;deviation detection method;one class support vector machine;OCSVM;conformal anomaly detection;most central pattern algorithm;MCP algorithm;CAD method;shape distribution;synthetic data set;real life self-monitoring scenario;city bus fleet;normal traffic;Gaussian kernel;Hellinger kernel;MCP method;Mahalanobis metric;Hellinger metric;k-nearest neighbour nonconformity measure;kNN nonconformity measure;normal data distribution;quantized p-values;multimodal distribution;asymmetric distribution;vehicle data","","8","","22","","5 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the convergence analysis of the binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT) algorithm which is a state-of-the-art recovery algorithm in one-bit compressive sensing. The basic idea of the convergence analysis is to view BIHT as a kind of projected subgradient method under sparsity constrains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence analysis of BIHT. We first consider a general convex function subject to sparsity constraints and connect it with the non-convex model in one-bit compressive sensing literatures. A projected subgradient method is proposed to solve the general model and some convergence results are established. A stronger convergence theorem for α-strongly convex functions without assumption on differentiable condition is also established. Furthermore, the corresponding stochastic projected subgradient method is provided with convergence guarantee. In our settings, BIHT is a special case of the projected subgradient method. Therefore, the convergence analysis can be applied to BIHT naturally. Then, we apply the projected subgradient method to some related non-convex optimization models arising in compressive sensing with 11-constraint, sparse support vector machines, and rectifier linear units regression. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to show the validity of our convergence analysis. The numerical experiments also show that the proposed projected subgradient method is very simple to implement, robust to sparse noise, and effective for sparse recovery problems.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2019.2922328","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11531013); fundamental research funds for the central universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11671358); NSAF of China(grant numbers:U1630116); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LR19A010001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8736270","One bit compressive sensing;sparsity;l₀ minimization;projected subgradient method;non-smooth optimization","Convergence;Compressed sensing;Stochastic processes;Linear programming;Convex functions;Optimization;Iterative algorithms","compressed sensing;concave programming;convergence;convex programming;gradient methods;iterative methods;optimisation;signal reconstruction;stochastic processes;support vector machines","sparsity constraints;BIHT;convergence analysis;one-bit compressive sensing theory;one-bit quantized linear measurements;binary iterative hard thresholding algorithm;stochastic projected subgradient method;convex function;sparse signals;sparse support vector machines;rectifier linear units regression","","3","","63","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, we explore the use of images of muzzles of pigs as a biometric identifier for uniquely distinguishing between pigs. To begin with, we form a series of conjectures leading to the selection of specific internal details visible on the muzzle's surface, which may collectively constitute a biometric identifier. These internal details include the muzzle shape contour, locations of the internal pores and cilia/hair and their density profiles, all of which are expected to be largely stable over time. Through content adaptive thresholding of Gaussian smoothed gradient magnitudes, gradient significance maps are generated which are used as quantized feature vectors (also termed as a patch statistic) for discrimination. Unsupervised classification results of mixed muzzle images based on this patch statistic shows significant promise.","","978-1-5386-2241-4","10.1109/ICAPR.2017.8593204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8593204","Pig;Muzzle;Gradient profile;Significance map;Patch;Animal Biometrics;Contour","Biomedical imaging;Shape;Cows;Hair;Color","biometrics (access control);farming;Gaussian processes;image classification;vectors","pigs;muzzle shape contour;mixed muzzle images;muzzle analysis;biometric identification;animal biometrics;biometric identifier;content adaptive thresholding;Gaussian smoothed gradient magnitudes;quantized feature vectors","","1","","8","","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, layout-to-image generation models have gained significant attention due to their capability to generate realistic and complex images containing distinct objects. These models are generally conditioned on either semantic layouts or textual descriptions. However, unlike natural images, providing auxiliary information can be extremely hard in domains such as biomedical imaging and remote sensing. In this work, we propose a multi-object generation framework1 that can synthesize images with multiple objects without explicitly requiring their contextual information during the generation process. Based on a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) backbone, our model learns to preserve spatial coherency within an image as well as semantic coherency through the use of powerful autoregressive priors. An advantage of our approach is that the generated samples are accompanied by object-level annotations. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through application on medical imaging datasets, where we show that augmenting the training set with the samples generated by our approach improves the performance of existing models.","2381-8549","978-1-6654-4115-5","10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9506406","Generative Modelling;VQ-VAE;Pixel-SNAIL;Multi-Object Generation;Data Augmentation","Training;Image segmentation;Biological system modeling;Semantics;Layout;Spatial coherence;Remote sensing","deep learning (artificial intelligence);image representation;image segmentation;image texture;object detection;vector quantisation","high-fidelity images;generative models;layout-to-image generation models;realistic images;complex images;distinct objects;semantic layouts;natural images;biomedical imaging;multiobject generation framework;semantic coherency;object-level annotations;medical imaging datasets;multiple coherent objects;textual descriptions;remote sensing;vector-quantized variational autoencoder;VQ-VAE;spatial coherency","","","","27","IEEE","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, two types of speaker embeddings are used. One is extracted from the mel spectrogram using a speaker encoder and the other is stored in an embedding dictionary, such as a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). To extract embedding from the embedding dictionary, an attention mechanism is applied, which we call attention- V AE (AT - V AE). By employing the embedding extracted by the speaker encoder as a query in the attention mechanism, the attention weights are calculated in the embedding dictionary. This mechanism allows the extraction of speaker embedding, which represents unseen speakers. In addition, training is applied to make our model robust to unseen speakers.

The accumulation of redundant images will result in excessive resource usage and inefficient cloud storage utilization. To get rid of the duplicates, hashing-based methods have been developed for the problem of image deduplication. However, as demonstrated in our experiments, current approaches fail in dataset with small visual difference, such as medical images. To this end, we propose QHash, which achieves effective image deduplication on the low-variance dataset. QHash leverages Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to learn the data distribution in an unsupervised manner. In addition, hash sequences are implemented using integer-based tensor, enabling distance calculation and deduplication being processed in parallel on either CPU or GPU.

This work focuses on the more relevant frequency selective case, where some important new aspects emerge. We consider a MIMO-OFDM broadcast channel and compare achievable ergodic rates under three channel state feedback schemes: analog feedback, direction quantized feedback and ""time-domain"" channel quantized feedback. The first two schemes are direct extensions of previously proposed schemes. The third scheme is novel, and it is directly inspired by rate-distortion theory of Gaussian correlated sources. For each scheme we derive the conditions under which the system achieves full multiplexing gain. The key difference with respect to the widely treated frequency-flat case is that in MIMO-OFDM the frequency domain channel transfer function is a Gaussian correlated source. The new time-domain quantization scheme takes advantage of the channel frequency correlation structure and outperforms the other schemes. Furthermore, it is by far simpler to implement than complicated spherical vector quantization. In particular, we observe that no structured codebook design and vector quantization is actually needed for efficient channel state information feedback.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2009.09.080162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5281760","MIMO broadcast channel, OFDM, channel state feedback, quantization.

Since the method adapts the transmit beamforming vector by computing the optimal direction of adaptation and feeds its quantized version back to the transmitter, we call it the quantized-feedback optimal adaptive (QFOA) beamforming algorithm. This algorithm offers a very fast-convergence and highly adaptive diversity technique. Fast convergence improves the system performance during the start-up period and helps remove the need to continuously tracking the antenna weights during intermittent periods where the transmitter does not transmit to a particular mobile user, or while the connection is temporarily suspended or idle. High convergence speed also provides a fast tracking capability demanded by high mobility applications. We also propose several quantization methods and prove analytically that they guarantee global convergence, irrespective of quantization error, since the gradient is always positive at any nonstationary point in the solution space.","1938-1883","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4025142","Transmit Diversity;Beam Forming;Space Time Coding;Directional Derivative;Constrained Optimization","Array signal processing;Transmitters;Downlink;Feedback;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Convergence;Quantization;Fading;Signal processing algorithms","","","","2","4","18","","11 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The promise of the field of `topological photonics' lines in the use of the physics of the quantum Hall effect and topological insulators, usually associated with electrons passing through solid-state materials, to provide robustness to complex photonic structures. In the quantum Hall effect, incredibly robust Hall conductivity - quantized transport - arose from the presence of scatter-free edge states permeating the entire structure. In other words, when a wavepacket moving along the edge encounters disorder of any kind, it simply passes through it unimpeded. The robustness of transport is associated with a `topological invariant' of the band structure: this is a quantity that can be calculated from the bulk band structure of the periodic lattice in question by calculating an associated Berry phase where the Bloch wave vector acts as the adiabatic parameter. Recently a great deal of effort has been directed towards the realization of photonic topological structures - photonic crystals (whether in the form of waveguide arrays, coupled-resonator-optical-waveguide structures, microwave photonic crystal slabs, among others) with quantum Hall-like protected transport along the edge. Here we show that we can use a waveguide-array based photonic topological insulator to protect photonic quantum information - namely we can preserve the character of `NOON' states (and other entangled states) as they propagate through such a lattice. NOON states are notoriously fragile entities and are entirely destroyed by any type of scattering: photonic topological protection could act as a novel mechanism for preserving these fragile quantum states in complex geometries.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7734548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7734548","","Photonics;Optical waveguides;Quantum entanglement;Topological insulators;Robustness","optical arrays;optical waveguides;photonic crystals;quantum entanglement;quantum Hall effect;quantum optics;topological insulators","NOON states;quantum Hall-like protected transport;microwave photonic crystal slabs;coupled resonator-optical waveguide structures;photonic crystals;adiabatic parameter;Bloch wave vector;Berry phase;periodic lattice;band structure;wavepacket;scatter-free edge states;quantized transport;robust Hall conductivity;complex photonic structures;quantum Hall effect;photonic quantum walks;quantum states;waveguide array-based photonic topological insulators;photonic quantum entanglement;topological protection","","1","","","","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Extending our work on RD optimized coding from the single layered to the multi-layered framework, we incorporate the additional inter-layer coding dependencies present in a multilayered framework into the set of permissible coding parameters. We employ the Lagrangian rate-distortion functional as it provides an elegant framework for determining the optimal choice of motion vectors, coding modes, and quantized coefficient levels by weighting a distortion term against a resulting rate term. We obtain a simple relationship between the Lagrangian parameter /spl lambda/, that controls rate-distortion tradeoffs, and the reference and enhancement layer quantization parameters QP, to allow the RD optimized framework to work easily in conjunction with rate control techniques that control the average bit rate by adjusting the quantization parameters. We then incorporate these relationships into our coder and generate two-layer bit streams with both the non-RD optimized coder and the RD optimized coder. We also generate RD optimized single-layer bit streams with the same resolution as the second layer of the two-layer bit streams. For the two-layer bit streams, we obtain a 0.6 to 1.4 dB improvement in PSNR by using RD optimization in both the base and enhancement layers. Compared to the single-layer bit stream, RD optimization in both the base and enhancement layers causes the decrease in PSNR to be reduced from 1.1 to 1.7 dB, to 0.3 to 0.5 dB.","1068-0314","0-7695-0096-X","10.1109/DCC.1999.785682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=785682","","Rate-distortion;Scalability;Video coding;Bit rate;Computer errors;Lagrangian functions;Quantization;PSNR;Streaming media;Resilience","video coding;optimisation;image resolution;discrete cosine transforms;transform coding;rate distortion theory;functional equations;image enhancement;quantisation (signal)","optimization;spatial scalability;DCT coding;video coding;multi-layered framework;inter-layer coding dependencies;Lagrangian rate-distortion functional;motion vectors;coding modes;quantized coefficient levels;distortion term weighting;rate term;enhancement layer;average bit rate control;two-layer bit streams;resolution","","","","3","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, based on the trained codebook, the speech features are quantized by the fuzzy sets and then are statistically applied to train the model of DHMM. Experimental results in this paper will show that the speech recognition rate can be improved by using FVQ algorithm to train the model of DHMM. The recognition rate by using an improved DHMM is only a little bit less than that by using GMHMM.

Moreover, it is exploited for motion analysis onsite to verify ""liveness"" as well as to achieve lip reading of digits. A methodological novelty is the suggested quantized angle features (""quangles"") being designed for illumination invariance without the need for preprocessing (e.g., histogram equalization). This is achieved by using both the gradient direction and the double angle direction (the structure tensor angle), and by ignoring the magnitude of the gradient. Boosting techniques are applied in a quantized feature space. A major benefit is reduced processing time (i.e., that the training of effective cascaded classifiers is feasible in very short time, less than 1 h for data sets of order 104). Scale invariance is implemented through the use of an image scale pyramid. We propose ""liveness"" verification barriers as applications for which a significant amount of computation is avoided when estimating motion. Novel strategies to avert advanced spoofing attempts (e.g., replayed videos which include person utterances) are demonstrated.

To address this issue, we introduce a robust Bayesian compressed sensing framework to account for sign flip errors. Specifically, sign-flip errors are considered as a result of a sparse noise-corrupted model in which original (unquantized) observations are corrupted by sparse (impulse) noise. A Gaussian-inverse Gamma hierarchical prior is assigned to the noise vector to promote sparsity.

Assuming zero-forcing transmission at the helper and random vector quantization of the channels, an analytic expression for the achievable ergodic secrecy rate due to the resulting quantization errors is derived. While direct optimization of the secrecy rate is difficult, an approximate upper bound for the mean loss in secrecy rate is derived and a feedback bit allocation method that minimizes the average upper bound on the secrecy rate loss is studied.

Compared with previously proposed covariance descriptors, our descriptor can be measured and clustered in Euclidian space. Second, to capture the geometric-temporal contextual information, we construct a directional pyramid co-occurrence matrix (DPCM) to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of the vector-quantized local feature descriptors extracted from a video. DPCM characterizes the co-occurrence statistics of local features as well as the spatio-temporal positional relationships among the concurrent features. These statistics provide strong descriptive power for action recognition. To use DPCM for action recognition, we propose a directional pyramid co-occurrence matching kernel to measure the similarity of videos.

Installation of DG to the existing system will produce additional fault current which may disturb the previously coordinated relays and lead to miscoordination of overcurrent relays. In this paper, an enhanced discrete differential evolution is introduced to perform the overcurrent relay coordination required to protect the radial distribution network with distributed generators.

However, existing methods often fail to capture accurate flows due to over-parameterization of texture deformation or employ a costly global optimization which makes the algorithm computationally demanding. In this paper, we address this inverse problem by casting it as a randomized correspondence search along with a locally-adaptive vector field smoothing. When a small example patch is given as a reference, a randomized deformable matching is performed on the very densely quantized label space, enabling an efficient estimation of texture deformation without quality degeneration, e.g., due to quantization artifacts which often appear in the optimization-driven discrete approaches. The visual similarity with respect to the deformation parameters is directly measured with an input texture image on an appearance space. The locally-adaptive smoothing is then applied to the intermediate flow field, resulting in a good continuation of the resultant texture flow. Experimental results on both synthetic and natural images show that the proposed method improves the performance in terms of both runtime efficiency and/or visual quality, compared to the existing methods.","2381-8549","978-1-4799-5751-4","10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7025945","Texture analysis;flow estimation;correspondence search;joint filtering","Smoothing methods;Estimation;Visualization;Vectors;Search problems;Labeling;Inference algorithms","deformation;image matching;image texture;inverse problems;optimisation;smoothing methods","visual quality;synthetic image;natural image;texture deformation estimation;densely quantized label space;randomized deformable matching;locally-adaptive vector field smoothing;randomized correspondence search;inverse problem;global optimization;texture deformation over-parameterization;visual similarity;randomized image texture flow estimation","","","","9","","29 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, secondary user can transmit using this free subspace in order to avoid interference at primary receiver. By employing transmit beamforming, secondary user can design its precoding matrix, where the interference to primary user can be aligned to the free subspace. As a result of non-degraded primary user's performance, perfect channel state information (CSI) is required at secondary transmitter. Unfortunately, this kind of CSI is hard to realize, it is therefore in this paper to investigate a limited CSI scheme. By secondary transmitter sensing the label of the Grassmannian quantized channel vectors, the proposed criterion can upper-bound the overall interference at primary receiver with a constant value, which is independent of secondary transmit power. We also study an alternative primary user power allocation strategy in order to balance the overall system performance.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-6337-2","10.1109/VTCSpring.2013.6692763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6692763","","Interference;Receivers;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Vectors;Transmitters;MIMO","array signal processing;radiofrequency interference;spread spectrum communication","Grassmannian quantized channel vectors;secondary transmitter;channel state information;precoding matrix;transmit beamforming;primary receiver;free subspace;channel links;power constraints;spatial interweave opportunistic spectrum reuse scheme;distributed interference alignment","","","","18","","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The tunable feature is achieved by controlling the number of each kind of syntax element to be encrypted. To simplify the implementation and save the computational cost, a simple control mechanism is proposed to adjust the control factors.

We look at this latter problem when some of these targets are to be quantized at very low bitrates ( 1 bit/target-scalar). The approach we take is to efficiently communicate a target-adaptive pattern of unequal bit-assignments (noise allocations) across each target. This can increase performance over an approach that has a constant noise allocation even when target vectors consist of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) scalars.

In the proposed method, a motion vector field (MVF) is constructed for each consecutive video frame by computing the motion vector (MV) of each macroblock. Then, the MVFs are divided into a number of local region of equal size. Next, the inconsistent/noisy MVs of each local region are eliminated by a motion consistency analysis. The remaining MVs of each local region from a number of consecutive frames are further collected for a compact representation. Initially, a matrix is formed using the MVs. Then, the matrix is decomposed using a singular value decomposition technique to represent the dominant motion. Finally, the angle of the most variance retaining principal component is computed and quantized to represent the motion of a local region by using a histogram. In order to represent the global camera motion, the local histograms are combined. The effectiveness of the proposed motion descriptor for video shot classification is tested by using a support vector machine. First, the proposed camera motion descriptors for video shots classification are computed on a video data set consisting of regular camera motion patterns (e.g., pan, zoom, tilt, static). Then, we apply the camera motion descriptors with an extended set of features to the classification of cinematographic shots. The experimental results show that the proposed shot level camera motion descriptor has a strong discriminative capability to classify different camera motion patterns of different videos effectively.

We assume that time evolution of both MIMO and MISO channels can be modeled as the first-order autoregressive process parameterized by a temporal-correlation coefficient. For a limited number of feedback bits, we would like to find out how often the feedback update should take place. Applying a large system limit and random vector quantization (RVQ), we derive the integer optimization problem, which determines the optimal feedback interval that maximizes the average capacity.

The multiresolution nature of the discrete wavelet transform is proven as a powerful tool to represent images decomposed along the vertical and horizontal directions using the pyramidal multiresolution scheme. The wavelet transform decomposes the image into a set of subimages called shapes with different resolutions corresponding to different frequency bands. Hence, different allocations are tested, assuming that details at high resolution and diagonal directions are less visible to the human eye. The resultant coefficients are vector quantized (VQ) using the LGB algorithm. By using an error correction method that approximates the reconstructed coefficients quantization error, we minimize distortion for a given compression rate at low computational cost. Several compression techniques are tested. In the first experiment, several 512/spl times/512 images are trained together and common table codes created. Using these tables, the training sequence black-and-white images achieve a compression ratio of 60-65 and a PSNR of 30-33. To investigate the compression on images not part of the training set, many 480/spl times/480 images of uncalibrated faces are trained together and yield global tables code. Images of faces outside the training set are compressed and reconstructed using the resulting tables. The compression ratio is 40; PSNRs are 30-36. Images from the training set have similar compression values and quality.

Most methods use the straight-through estimator (STE) to train quantized networks, which avoids a zero-gradient problem by replacing a derivative of a discretizer (i.e., a round function) with that of an identity function. Although quantized networks exploiting the STE have shown decent performance, the STE is sub-optimal in that it simply propagates the same gradient without considering discretization errors between inputs and outputs of the discretizer. In this paper, we propose an element-wise gradient scaling (EWGS), a simple yet effective alternative to the STE, training a quantized network better than the STE in terms of stability and accuracy. Given a gradient of the discretizer output, EWGS adaptively scales up or down each gradient element, and uses the scaled gradient as the one for the discretizer input to train quantized networks via backpropagation. The scaling is performed depending on both the sign of each gradient element and an error between the continuous input and discrete output of the discretizer. We adjust a scaling factor adaptively using Hessian information of a network. We show extensive experimental results on the image classification datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with diverse network architectures under a wide range of bit-width settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-4509-2","10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00638","Samsung; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9578025","","Training;Deep learning;Computer vision;Quantization (signal);Computer architecture;Network architecture;Hardware","backpropagation;gradient methods;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;quantisation (signal);vector quantisation","scaled gradient;discretizer input;quantized network;gradient element;discrete output;diverse network architectures;element-wise gradient scaling;network quantization aims;deep neural networks;STE;zero-gradient problem;discretization errors;discretizer output","","4","","47","","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to MIMO, HPO-RF receivers are simplified significantly, and have much lower power consumption and fabrication cost. Two types of channel estimators and multiuser detectors are developed for HPO-MIMO from the perspectives of numerical optimization and Bayesian inference. Firstly, because  $\pi $ -periodic phases provide tan-relationships between the Inphase (I) and Quadrature (Q) components, the channel estimation (CE) and multiuser detection (MUD) problems are resolved by minimizing  $l_{2}$ -norm cost functions with unit-norm constraint on the recovered vector. Their solutions are obtained by deriving the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue through shifted power method (SPW). Secondly, the CE and MUD problems are categorized as generalized linear mixing problems under (un-)quantized  $\pi $ -periodic phase measurements, and then handled by generalized approximate message passing (GAMP), where closed-form solutions for mean-and-variance messages involving  $\pi $ -periodic phases are derived. Finally, magnitude and  $\pi $ -phase ambiguities persisting in signal recovery are removed based on the complex-valued full measurements from the single classical RF chain. Simulation results show that GAMP-type algorithms outperform SPW-type ones, and handle nonlinear phase quantization losses. 16-sector quantized HPO-MIMO could work as well as its un-quantized correspondence.

Low-bit neural network quantization provides a powerful solution to dramatically reduce their model size. Current quantization methods are based on uniform precision and fail to account for the varying performance sensitivity at different parts of LMs to quantization errors. To this end, novel mixed precision neural network LM quantization methods are proposed in this paper. The optimal local precision choices for LSTM-RNN and Transformer based neural LMs are automatically learned using three techniques. The first two approaches are based on quantization sensitivity metrics in the form of either the KL-divergence measured between full precision and quantized LMs, or Hessian trace weighted quantization perturbation that can be approximated efficiently using matrix free techniques. The third approach is based on mixed precision neural architecture search. In order to overcome the difficulty in using gradient descent methods to directly estimate discrete quantized weights, alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) are used to efficiently train quantized LMs. Experiments were conducted on state-of-the-art LF-MMI CNN-TDNN systems featuring speed perturbation, i-Vector and learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC) based speaker adaptation on two tasks: Switchboard telephone speech and AMI meeting transcription. The proposed mixed precision quantization techniques achieved “lossless” quantization on both tasks, by producing model size compression ratios of up to approximately 16 times over the full precision LSTM and Transformer baseline LMs, while incurring no statistically significant word error rate increase.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2021.3129357","Hong Kong Research Grants Council GRF(grant numbers:14200218,14200220,14200021); Innovation and Technology Fund(grant numbers:ITS/254/19); Shun Hing Institute of Advanced Engineering(grant numbers:MMT-p1-19); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9622190","Language models;speech recognition;LSTM-RNN;transformer;low-bit quantization;ADMM","Quantization (signal);Transformers;Recurrent neural networks;Speech recognition;Long short term memory","gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;quantisation (signal);recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","direction methods;quantized LMs;state-of-the-art LF-MMI CNN-TDNN systems;mixed precision quantization techniques;lossless quantization;model size compression ratios;precision LSTM;Transformer baseline LMs;mixed precision low-bit quantization;neural network language models;state-of-the-art language models;LSTM-RNNs;low-bit neural network quantization;current quantization methods;uniform precision;varying performance sensitivity;novel mixed precision neural network LM quantization methods;optimal local precision choices;neural LMs;quantization sensitivity metrics;Hessian trace weighted quantization perturbation;mixed precision neural architecture search;gradient descent methods;discrete quantized weights","","1","","99","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such vector quantizers have been widely used in the areas of speech coding and speech recognition. The conventional vector quantizer utilizes only spectral shape information and essentially disregards the energy or gain term associated with the optimal LPC fit to the signal being modeled. In this paper we present a method of incorporating LPC spectral shape and energy into the code-book entries of the vector quantizer. To do this, we postulate a distortion measure for comparing two LPC vectors that uses the weighted sum of an LPC shape distortion and a log energy distortion. Based on this combined distortion measure, we have designed and studied vector quantizers of several sizes for use in isolated word speech recognition experiments. We found that a fairly significant correlation exists between LPC shape and signal energy. Hence, an LPC shape combined with energy vector quantizer with a given distortion requires far fewer code-book entries than one in which LPC shape and energy are quantized separately. Based on isolated word recognition tests on both a 10-digit and a 129-word airlines vocabulary, we found improvements in recognition accuracy by using the VQ with both LPC shape and energy over that obtained using a VQ with LPC shape alone.","0748-612X","","10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00104.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6768363","","","","","","9","","","","29 Apr 2014","","","Nokia Bell Labs","Nokia Bell Labs Journal"

It synthesizes data for calibrating the quantized model according to the batch normalization (BN) statistics of FP32 ones and significantly relieves the heavy dependency on real training data in traditional quantization methods. Unfortunately, we find that in practice, the synthetic data identically constrained by BN statistics suffers serious homogenization at both distribution level and sample level and further causes a significant performance drop of the quantized model. We propose Diverse Sample Generation (DSG) scheme to mitigate the adverse effects caused by homogenization. Specifically, we slack the alignment of feature statistics in the BN layer to relax the constraint at the distribution level and design a layerwise enhancement to reinforce specific layers for different data samples. Our DSG scheme is versatile and even able to be applied to the state-of-the-art post-training quantization method like AdaRound. We evaluate the DSG scheme on the large-scale image classification task and consistently obtain significant improvements over various network architectures and quantization methods, especially when quantized to lower bits (e.g., up to 22% improvement on W4A4).

However, the problem of quantization of Winograd convolutions is challenging - while quantization of slower Winograd algorithms does not cause problems, quantization of faster Winograd algorithms often leads to a significant drop in the quality of models. We introduce a novel class of Winograd algorithms that balances the filter and input channels in the Winograd domain. Unlike traditional Winograd convolutions, the proposed convolution balances the ranges of input channels on the forward pass by scaling the input tensor using special balancing coefficients (the filter channels are balanced offline). As a result of balancing, the inputs and filters of the Winograd convolution are much easier to quantize. Thus, the proposed technique allows us to obtain models with quantized Winograd convolutions, the quality of which is significantly higher than the quality of models with traditional quantized Winograd convolutions. Moreover, we propose a special direct algorithm for calculating the balancing coefficients, which does not require additional model training. This algorithm makes it easy to obtain the post-training quantized balanced Winograd convolutions - one should just feed a few data samples to the model without training to calibrate special parameters. In addition, it is possible to initialize the balancing coefficients using this algorithm and further train them as trainable variables during Winograd quantization-aware training for greater quality improvement.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-6946-3","10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878459","Efficient learning and inferences; Deep learning architectures and techniques; Optimization methods","Training;Deep learning;Quantization (signal);Tensors;Convolution;Optimization methods;Filtering algorithms","computational complexity;convolution;convolutional codes;filtering theory;image coding;pattern clustering;quantisation (signal);tensors;vector quantisation","small-size convolutions;slower Winograd algorithms;faster Winograd algorithms;input channels;Winograd domain;traditional Winograd convolutions;special balancing coefficients;traditional quantized Winograd convolutions;Winograd quantization-aware training;channel balancing;accurate quantization;Winograd convolution algorithms speed","","","","29","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a 4.8 kbit/s coder, the short-term filter parameters have to be quantized at 1 kbit/s or less and conventional scalar quantizers at this bit rate result in severe degradation of output speech. In this paper we describe the performance of stochastic coders when the short-term filter parameters are quantized using direct vector quantization and vector quantization with predictive coding and eigenvector rotation. Our results indicate that good performance can be achieved with relatively small codebooks for the quantizers and that predictive coding with eigenvector rotation gives a small but consistent improvement over direct vector quantization.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.1987.1169442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1169442","","Encoding;Filters;Stochastic processes;Vector quantization;Bit rate;Degradation;Predictive coding;Speech synthesis;Speech coding;Linear predictive coding","","","","3","2","6","","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the feedback overhead of beamforming matrixes may significantly reduce the FDD system throughput. Efficient feedback techniques were reported recently. However, their complexities can be prohibitively high for systems with large numbers of transmit antennas (M/sub t/) and spatial streams (M/sub s/) since numerous large matrix codebooks of Grassman manifold packing G(M/sub f/,M/sub s/) are required. In Roh et al. (2004), it is shown that the beamforming matrix can be parameterized by independent unit vectors. This implies that quantizing the matrix jointly is equivalent to quantizing the vectors separately. Firsts we show that the distributions of the unit vectors are isotropic on unit spheres. Secondly, a low-complexity, scalable quantization scheme is derived. The key innovation lies in the quantization of the large dimension unit vectors. Each large dimension unit vector is partitioned into smaller dimension vectors and quantized by small size codebooks designed for low dimension unit vectors, and the partition itself is quantized by a 3-bit codebook. Finally, an interpolation scheme is proposed for beamforming matrixes downsampled in frequency domain, which significantly reduces overhead for MIMO-OFDM systems. The missing beamforming vectors are interpolated along the geodesic connecting two fed back vectors on a unit sphere. Simulations demonstrate that the overhead in IEEE 802.16d/e draft can be reduced by a factor of three using the proposed scheme.","1550-2252","0-7803-8887-9","10.1109/VETECS.2005.1543275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1543275","MIMO;feedback;SVD;beamforming;interpolation","Feedback;Array signal processing;MIMO;Transmitting antennas;Quantization;Throughput;Technological innovation;Interpolation;Frequency domain analysis;Joining processes","feedback;MIMO systems;OFDM modulation;array signal processing;transmitting antennas;quantisation (signal);interpolation;sampling methods;IEEE standards;matrix algebra;channel coding;radio access networks;broadband networks;mobile radio","compact feedback;MIMO-OFDM systems;frequency selective channels;transmit beamforming;performance;multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems;transmit antennas;spatial streams;matrix codebooks;Grassman manifold packing;beamforming matrix;isotropic unit vector distributions;low-complexity scalable quantization;large dimension unit vectors;small size codebooks;3-bit codebook;interpolation scheme;downsampling;IEEE 802.16d/e draft","","8","4","15","","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a limited feedback system where each receiver knows its channel perfectly, but the transmitter is only provided with a finite number of channel feedback bits from each receiver. Using a random quantization argument, we quantify the throughput loss due to imperfect channel knowledge as a function of the feedback level. The quality of channel knowledge must improve proportional to the SNR in order to prevent interference-limitations, and we show that scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the system SNR is sufficient to maintain a bounded rate loss.

Multi-mode precoding uses linear transmit precoding that adapts the number of spatial multiplexing data streams or modes, according to the transmit channel state information (CSI). As such, it typically requires complete knowledge of the multi-mode precoding matrices for each subcarrier at the transmitter. In practical scenarios where the CSI is acquired at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter through a low-rate feedback link, this requirement may entail a prohibitive feedback overhead. In this paper, we propose to reduce the feedback requirement by combining codebook-based precoder quantization, to efficiently quantize and represent the optimal precoder on each subcarrier, and multi-mode precoder frequency down-sampling and interpolation, to efficiently reconstruct the precoding matrices on all subcarriers based on the feedback of the indexes of the quantized precoders only on a fraction of the subcarriers. To enable this efficient interpolation-based quantized multimode precoding solution, we introduce (1) a novel precoder codebook design that lends itself to precoder interpolation, across subcarriers, followed by mode selection, (2) a new precoder interpolator and, finally, (3) a clustered mode selection approach that significantly reduces the feedback overhead related to the mode information on each subcarrier.

The direct combination of existing beamforming schemes with 1-bit DACs is shown to lead to an error floor at medium-to-high SNR regime, due to the coarse quantization of the DACs with limited precision. In this paper, based on the constructive interference, we consider both a quantized linear beamforming scheme where we analytically obtain the optimal beamforming matrix and a non-linear mapping scheme where we directly design the transmit signal vector. Due to the 1-bit quantization, the formulated optimization for the non-linear mapping scheme is shown to be non-convex. The non-convex constraints of the 1-bit DACs are first relaxed into convex, followed by an element-wise normalization to satisfy the 1-bit DAC transmission. We further propose a low-complexity symbol scaling scheme that consists of three stages, in which the quantized transmit signal on each antenna element is selected sequentially.

A nonlinear-precoded secure transmission strategy is proposed using Tomlinson–Harashima precoding at the transmitter and null-space beamforming at the helper based on the quantized CSI. The accurate closed-form expression of an approximation for the ergodic rate of each legitimate user is obtained using quantization cell approximation for random vector quantization of the channels. Assuming the quantized CSI of the legitimate channels and the helper's channel at the eavesdropper, closed-form expression of an upper bound of the ergodic rate of each user's message at the eavesdropper is also derived. Then, a closed-form expression of an approximation for the worst-case ergodic secrecy sum rate follows. We also theoretically show that, besides the advantage in ergodic rate over the linear precoding scheme, when the quantized CSI is not available at the eavesdropper, Tomlinson–Harashima precoding is also more effective in degrading the received signal quality at the eavesdropper, and, thus, is more capable to enhance the secrecy of the systems compared with the linear precoding scheme. Given the total bandwidth constraint of CSI-feedback channels, an adaptive feedback bit allocation algorithm is proposed for each legitimate user to optimize the ergodic secrecy rate performance.

Earlier work by Juang and Gray has shown that vector quantization can provide a significant reduction in the bit rate needed to quantize the LPC parameters. Previous work on vector quantization of LPC parameters employed trained codebooks. In this paper, we describe a stochastic model of LPC-derived log areas that eliminates training of the codebook by constructing codebook entries from random sequences. Each vector of LPC parameters is modelled as a sample function of zero mean Gaussian stochastic process with known covariances. We generate an ensemble of Gaussian codewords with a specified distribution where the number of codewords in the ensemble is determined by the number of bits used to quantize the LPC parameter vector. The optimum codeword is selected by exhaustive search to minimize the Euclidean distance between the original and quantized parameters. Our results show that vector quantization using random codebooks can provide a SNR of 20 dB in quantizing 10 log area parameters with 28 bits/frame.

This paper develops low-complexity hybrid analog/digital precoding for downlink multiuser mmWave systems. Hybrid precoding involves a combination of analog and digital processing that is inspired by the power consumption of complete radio frequency and mixed signal hardware. The proposed algorithm configures hybrid precoders at the transmitter and analog combiners at multiple receivers with a small training and feedback overhead. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in the large dimensional regime and in single-path channels.

We discover that joint training is able to produce comparable performance on the adaptive model as individual models.

By properly setting training parameters, such as batch size and learning rate, bit widths of both weights and activations can be uniformly quantized down to 4 bit while maintaining full precision accuracy. In this article, we present a retraining-based mixed-precision quantization approach and its customized DNN accelerator to achieve high energy efficiency. In the proposed quantization, in the middle of retraining, an additional bit (extra quantization level) is assigned to the weights that have shown frequent switching between two contiguous quantization levels since it means that both quantization levels cannot help to reduce quantization loss. We also mitigate the gradient noise that occurs in the retraining process by taking a lower learning rate near the quantization threshold. For the proposed novel mixed-precision quantized network (MPQ-network), we have implemented a customized accelerator using a 65-nm CMOS process. In the accelerator, the proposed processing elements (PEs) can be dynamically reconfigured to process variable bit widths from 2 to 4 bit for both weights and activations. The numerical results show that the proposed quantization can achieve  $1.37 {\times }$  better compression ratio for VGG-9 using CIFAR-10 data set compared with a uniform 4-bit (both weights and activations) model without loss of classification accuracy.

Since interference exists among users, the traditional single-user optimization-based precoding scheme exhibits poor performance. To improve the multi-user uplink sum-rate performance, a scheme incorporating an iterative multiple user PVI selection algorithm is proposed that iteratively projects one user channel into the null space of the precoded channels of other users, and obtains the PVI from the projected space.

While it learns to compress the images from a training set, the compression performance is very well generalized on images from a test set. Moreover, when fed with noisy versions of the test set, since it has priors from clean images, the network also efficiently denoises the test images during the reconstruction. The proposed framework is a regularized version of the Residual Quantization (RQ) where at each stage, the quantization error from the previous stage is further quantized. Instead of codebook learning from the k-means which over-trains for high-dimensional vectors, we show that only generating the codewords from a random, but properly regularized distribution suffices to compress the images globally and without the need to resort to patch-based division of images.

Existing hybrid precoding schemes either require full channel state information (CSI) or use codebook-based design, causing large feedback overhead or degraded system performance, respectively. In this paper, we propose a balanced scheme with limited feedback CSI and element-level quantization. Our key idea is to maximize the system sum rate by using an adaptive baseband precoder and an eigenbeam radio frequency (RF) precoder. The adaptive baseband precoder can balance the effective channel gain and the multiuser interference according to the transmitted power. The eigenbeam RF precoder is optimized with only requiring a limited length of feedback vector.

In this paper, we propose two new structured constructions to generate different codebooks at each user via transformations of a base codebook. The first construction is based on the Householder transform, which is used to construct a different codebook at each user for most types of base codebooks, with no storage in addition to the base codebook. A feature of our first construction is that the transformed codebook using the Fourier base codebook has a search complexity reduction of up to 50% compared to the standard approach, although only one additional unique codebook can be constructed with this type of base codebook. To construct multiple different codebooks using the Fourier base codebook, we propose a second construction that is based on the representation theory of groups. We show that both our constructions significantly reduce storage requirements compared with the intuitive but impractical random construction, while obtaining the same sum-rate performance. In particular, we only require elements generated directly from the base codebook or from finite fields, instead of random complex numbers.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2013.051013.120782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6517777","Limited feedback;precoding;multiuser MIMO","Vectors;Transforms;Quantization (signal);MIMO;Downlink;Memory management;Standards","MIMO communication;precoding;telecommunication channels;transforms","sparse limited feedback codebooks;structured limited feedback codebooks;multiuser MIMO;zero-forcing precoding;quantized channel state information;base station;codebook;reduced sum-rate;Householder transform;transformed codebook;search complexity reduction;Fourier base codebook;representation theory;impractical random construction;sum-rate performance;random complex numbers","","5","","26","","21 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work develops the source coding dual of the IF approach to arrive at a new low-complexity scheme, IF source coding, for distributed lossy compression of correlated Gaussian sources under a minimum mean squared error distortion measure. All encoders use the same nested lattice codebook. Each encoder quantizes its observation using the fine lattice as a quantizer and reduces the result modulo the coarse lattice, which plays the role of binning. Rather than directly recovering the individual quantized signals, the decoder first recovers a full-rank set of judiciously chosen integer linear combinations of the quantized signals, and then inverts it. In general, the linear combinations have smaller average powers than the original signals. This allows to increase the density of the coarse lattice, which in turn translates to lower compression rates. We also propose and analyze a one-shot version of IF source coding, that is simple enough to potentially lead to a new design principle for analog-to-digital converters that can exploit spatial correlations between the sampled signals.","2157-8117","978-1-4799-5186-4","10.1109/ISIT.2014.6874819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6874819","","Lattices;Source coding;Decoding;Vectors;Quantization (signal);Rate-distortion","Gaussian channels;least mean squares methods;MIMO communication;quantisation (signal);signal sampling;source coding","integer-forcing source coding;IF source coding;compute-and-forward;multiple integer linear combinations;Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output channel;distributed lossy compression;Gaussian sources;minimum mean squared error distortion measure;lattice codebook;fine lattice;coarse lattice;quantized signals;compression rates;analog-to-digital converters;spatial correlations","","2","","14","","11 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this, in case of a centralized approach, users need to unicast the quantized channel state information (CSI), typically to the anchor base station (BS), and then each BS forwards this information to a central coordination node for precoding and scheduling. In the case of a decentralized approach, users broadcast the quantized CSI such that the coordinating BSs could simultaneously receive the CSI. The advantage of a decentralized approach is that it does not require a central coordination node, thereby not imposing stringent latency constraints on the backhaul. The CSI transmission over the erroneous feedback channel in the uplink gives rise to precoding loss and scheduling loss. In the decentralized framework, the feedback errors could result in BSs receiving a different version of the CSI. In this work, we propose a decentralized opportunistic scheduling approach, which only requires a minimal sharing of scheduling information between BSs. The results show that the sum rate achieved with the proposed method is comparable to that of the centralized approach even when there is a high bit error probability introduced by the feedback channel. We also show that when the bit error probabilities in the feedback channel are less than 10-4, the decentralized approach achieves the sum rate of the centralized approach.","2166-9589","978-1-4673-2569-1","10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6362540","Broadcast CSI;CoMP;Decentralized Architecture;Scheduling","Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Error probability;Quantization;Vectors;Unicast;Indexes","cellular radio;error statistics;precoding;scheduling","broadcast CSI potential;opportunistic coordinated multipoint transmission;cell-edge performance;centralized approach;quantized channel state information;anchor base station;central coordination node;precoding loss;scheduling loss;feedback errors;decentralized opportunistic scheduling approach;bit error probability;feedback channel","","","","15","","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead, our algorithm clusters the collection of channel states to a much lower dimension, and for each cluster provides achievable multiuser capacity trade-offs, which can be used for user and rate selection. Our algorithm uses a bandit approach, where it learns both the unknown partitions of the channel-state space (channel-state clustering) as well as the capacity region for each cluster along a pre-specified set of directions, by observing the success/failure of the scheduling decisions (e.g. through packet loss). We propose an epoch-greedy learning algorithm that achieves a sub-linear regret, given access to a class of classifying functions over the channel-state space.

Moreover, the linear independence of the PMs also permits multiplexing in MMFs. To effectively utilize these PMs at the transmitter, it is essential to estimate them and feed them back to the transmitter. In this paper, we propose quantization schemes that enable efficient encapsulation of the PMs for feedback for MMFs with a small number of modes. For shorter links, we use vector quantization codebooks based on the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm, while for long links with low mode dependent losses (MDL), we show analytically that the PMs are Haar distributed, and use Grassmannian line packing based codebooks. Simulations reveal that the quantization limits dispersion and the performance of the quantized PMs is within 2 dB of the ideal principal modes with only 6 bits quantization, both with and without MDL.

FDI methods, like the prototype waveform interpolation (PWI) methods, derive a prototype waveform (PW) at regular intervals of time. But, unlike PWI, there is no separation into a slowly evolving waveform (SEW) and a rapidly evolving waveform (REW) component. Instead, the PW is encoded after gain normalization in magnitude-phase form. The magnitude is modeled as a sum of mean and deviation values in multiple frequency bands and this model is quantized using switched backward adaptive VQ techniques. The phase information is represented as a composite vector of PW correlations in multiple frequency bands and an overall voicing measure. This information is quantized using a VQ at the encoder. At the decoder, a phase model is employed that uses the received phase (and magnitude) information to reproduce PWs with the correct periodicity and evolutionary characteristics. Speech is synthesized by interpolating the reconstructed PWs after gain adjustment and filtering it using the short-term predictor and a postfilter. The design of a 4-kb/s and a 2.4-kb/s FDI codec are presented in this paper and their performance is characterized in terms of delay, complexity, and subjective voice quality.

We prove that this digital interface is near optimal for Gaussian relay networks and the capacities of the Gaussian and the discrete networks are within a bounded gap of O(M2) bits, where M is the number of nodes.

We exploit this property by designing a linear coding strategy for the case of layered discrete relay networks. The linear coding strategy is near optimal and achieves all rates within O(M2) bits of the capacity, independent of channel gains or signal-to-noise ratio. The linear code is therefore a near-optimal strategy for layered Gaussian relay networks and can be used as on the Gaussian network after simply quantizing the signals. The relays in the linear code need not know the channel gains on either the incoming or the outgoing links. The transmit and receive signals at all relays are simply quantized to binary tuples of the same length n, which is all that the nodes need to know. The linear network code is a particularly simple scheme and requires all the relay nodes to collect the received binary tuples into a long binary vector and apply a linear transformation on the long vector. The resulting binary vector is split into smaller binary tuples for transmission by the relays. The quantization requirements of the linear network code are completely defined by the parameter n, which therefore also determines the resolution of the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters that are required for operating the network within a bounded gap of the network's capacity. As evident from the description, the linear network code explicitly connects network coding for wireline networks with codes for Gaussian networks.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2012.2235906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392279","Deterministic models;discrete superposition model;network coding;relay networks","Relays;Encoding;Quantization;Network coding;Receiving antennas;Signal to noise ratio;Approximation methods","digital-analogue conversion;Gaussian processes;linear codes;network coding;relay networks (telecommunication);vector quantisation;wireless channels","near-optimal quantization;linear network coding;discrete network;Gaussian wireless network;received signal quantization;quantization-based digital interface;near-optimal coding strategy;discrete relay networks;channel gain;signal-to-noise ratio;binary tuple;linear transformation;long binary vector;analog-to-digital converter;digital-to-analog converter;wireline networks","","2","","30","","21 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Having the count vectors in hand, we introduce a new mixture model for the accurate modeling of these vectors. This mixture model is based on a composition of the Beta-Liouville distribution and the multinomial. The novel proposed model, that we call multinomial Beta-Liouville mixture, is optimized by expectation-maximization (EM) and minimum description length, and strives to achieve a high accuracy of textured image data discrimination.

However, very different clusterings algorithms are at our disposal, each of them discovering different structures in the data. In this paper, we explore how to combine these heterogeneous codebooks and introduce a novel approach for their integration via consensus clustering. Considering each visual vocabulary as one modal, we propose the visual word aggregation (VWA) methodology, to learn a common codebook, where the stability of the visual vocabulary construction process is increased, the size of the codebook is determined in an unsupervised integration, and more discriminative representations are obtained. With the aim of obtaining contextual visual words, we also incorporate the spatial neighboring relation between the local descriptors into the VWA process: the contextual-VWA approach. We integrate over-segmentation algorithms and spatial grids into the aggregation process to obtain a visual vocabulary that narrows the semantic gap between visual words and visual concepts. We show how the proposed codebooks perform in recognizing objects and scenes on very challenging datasets.

We present an index-assignment algorithm that minimizes the impact of feedback errors. The proposed algorithm requires exhaustive search to find the best mapping.

The co-occurrence histograms of oriented gradients (CoHOG) feature descriptor showed good performance since thirty co-occurrences at each pixel position represent various spatial characteristics of object shapes. Though extraction of co-occurrence histogram features is computationally demanding, there is an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to accelerate the computation. The hardware accelerator enables CoHOG to be used in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose the use of two co-occurrence histogram features describing different aspects of object shapes to improve accuracy of pedestrian detection. One feature is CoHOG and the other is co-occurrence histograms of local binary patterns (CoHLBP). CoHLBP assigns each pixel into eight categories by comparing a center pixel's value and its three neighbors' values, and then co-occurrence histograms are calculated in the same way as for CoHOG. Since the number of local binary patterns is the same as the number of quantized orientations used in CoHOG, the CoHOG hardware accelerator can be used for CoHLBP calculation. The experimental results using the benchmark NICTA pedestrian dataset show that the proposed method reduces the false positive rate to less than one-quarter of that of CoHOG.","0730-6512","978-1-4799-2190-4","10.1109/ACPR.2013.117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778352","pedestrian detection;hardware accelerator;CoHLBP;CoHOG;co-occurrence histograms","Histograms;Feature extraction;Hardware;Vectors;Support vector machines;Accuracy;Conferences","application specific integrated circuits;feature extraction;gradient methods;object detection;pedestrians","cooccurrence histogram features;gradient orientations;local binary patterns;pedestrian detection;CoHOG feature descriptor;object shapes;feature extraction;application-specific integrated circuit;ASIC;CoHLBP","","7","","11","","27 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since each antenna element is equipped with its own power amplifier, a norm power constraint, which restricts the transmit power with the expected norm of the transmit signal vector, is not suitable for practical systems. Therefore, we consider a shaping constraint (SC), which imposes a limit on the shape of the transmit covariance matrix. The SC includes several power constraints such as the peak power constraint and the per-antenna power constraint as special cases. To this end, we first derive the optimal structure of the MMSE relay transceiver under the SC. Then, by introducing an upper bound of the mean square error, we provide closed-form relay transceiver solutions. Due to limited bandwidth of the feedback channel, perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter may not be feasible. Thus, we also propose a quantized relay transceiver design based on Grassmannian codebooks for a limited-feedback scenario.

This scheme results in the increased lifetime of the WSN compared to similar approaches that are based on the minimization of the sum of the local transmit powers. The limitation of the proposed optimal power-allocation scheme is that it requires the feedback of the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) from the FC to local sensors, which is not practical in most applications of large-scale WSNs. In this paper, a limited-feedback strategy is proposed that eliminates this requirement by designing an optimal codebook for the FC using the generalized Lloyd algorithm with modified distortion metrics.

A multichannel filter is used to transform the random sequence into an intermediate set of variables that are quantized using independent scalar quantizers, and then inverse-filtered, producing a quantized version of the original sequence. Equal word-length and optimal word-length quantization at high bit rates is considered. An analytical solution for the filter that minimizes the mean-squared quantization error is obtained in terms of its singular value decomposition. The performance is characterized by a set of invariants termed second-order modes, which are derived from the eigenvalue decomposition of the matrix-valued power spectrum. A more general rank-reduced model is used for decreasing distortion by introducing bias. The results are specialized to the case when the vector-valued time series is obtained from a scalar random sequence, which gives rise to a filter bank model for quantization. The asymptotic performance of such a subband coder is derived and shown to coincide with the asymptotic bound for transform coding. Quantization employing a single scalar pre- and postfilter, traditional transform coding using a square linear transformation, and subband coding in filter banks, arise as special cases of the structure analyzed here.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.508840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=508840","","Transform coding;Quantization;Random sequences;Filter bank;Vectors;Nonlinear filters;Bit rate;Matrix decomposition;Distortion measurement;Singular value decomposition","transform coding;random processes;quantisation (signal);filtering theory;band-pass filters;singular value decomposition;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;time series;least mean squares methods","minimum mean-squared error transform coding;subband coding;power spectrum;stationary random sequence;signal quantization;multichannel filter;independent scalar quantizers;inverse-filtering;equal word-length;optimal word-length quantization;high bit rates;vector-valued time series;filter bank model;singular value decomposition;performance;invariants;second-order modes;eigenvalue decomposition;matrix-valued power spectrum;rank-reduced model;distortion;bias","","22","2","24","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to directly represent a mean-removed block using a redundant dictionary consisting of all possible inter-prediction candidates with integer motion vectors (mean-removed). In general the dictionary may also contain some intra-prediction candidates and some pre-designed fixed dictionary atoms. However, simulation results reported in this papers are obtained by using the inter-prediction candidates only. We determine the coefficients by minimizing the L0 norm of the coefficients subject to a constraint on the sparse approximation error. We show that using such a self-adaptive dictionary can lead to a very sparse representation, with significantly fewer non-zero coefficients than using the DCT transform on the prediction error. We further propose a modified orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm which othonormalizes each new chosen atom with respect to all previously chosen and orthonormalized atoms. Each image block is represented by the quantized coefficients corresponding to the othonormalized atoms, to overcome the inefficiency associated with using non-orthonormal atoms. Each image block is represented by its mean, which is predictively coded, the indices of the chosen atoms, and the quantized coefficients. Each variable is coded based on its unconditional distribution.

Conventional coding schemes are designed to try to minimize the spectral distortion of the quantized LSF vectors without considering those of interpolated ones. However, a considerable performance could be gained by exploiting this subframe interpolation operation. This paper presents a novel and efficient LSF coding approach. The proposed subframe- weighted LSF distance measure allows a coder to improve the LSF coding performance over all subframes of all frames.

The former maps the trajectories from the time domain to the frequency domain, and the latter quantizes a list of frequency spectra to a finite number of prototype spectrum-vectors, called symbols. The second stage is training of the HMM. The unknown model parameters in the HMM are tuned by the concept of counting event occurrences. The quantized symbols are counted so that probabilities of occurrences are applied to train the HMM. The third stage is measurement of the consistency of every trajectory. Each trajectory is sent through the trained HMM. A probability-based likelihood index is evaluated which reflects the consistency of the trajectory with the HMM.

However, most existing signal-based measures are designed to be applied to single-channel signals. Measures specifically designed to take into account the binaural properties of the signal are often intrusive – characterised by requiring access to a clean speech signal – and typically rely on combining both channels into a single-channel signal before making predictions. This letter proposes a non-intrusive SI measure that computes features from a binaural input signal using a combination of vector quantization (VQ) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) methods. vector quantized contrastive predictive coding (VQ-CPC) feature extraction does not rely on any model of the auditory system and is instead trained to maximise the mutual information between the input signal and output features. The computed VQ-CPC features are input to a predicting function parameterized by a neural network. Two predicting functions are considered in this letter. Both feature extractor and predicting functions are trained on simulated binaural signals with isotropic noise. They are tested on simulated signals with isotropic and real noise. For all signals, the ground truth scores are the (intrusive) deterministic binaural short-time objective intelligibility (STOI). Results are presented in terms of correlations and mean-squared error (MSE) and demonstrate that VQ-CPC features are able to capture information relevant to modelling SI and outperform all the considered benchmarks – even when evaluating on data comprising of different noise field types.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2022.3161115","RISE Exchange Program through the German Academic Exchange Service; Augmented Auditory Intelligence; German Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:16SV8594); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739900","Contrastive predictive coding, non-intrusive speech intelligibility prediction;self-supervised representation learning","Feature extraction;Training;Indexes;Speech processing;Speech coding;Speech recognition;Predictive models","feature extraction;mean square error methods;neural nets;speech intelligibility;vector quantisation","simulated binaural signals;short-time objective intelligibility;nonintrusive binaural speech intelligibility prediction;discrete latent representations;nonintrusive speech intelligibility prediction;signal-based measures;single-channel signal;binaural properties;clean speech signal;nonintrusive SI measure;binaural input signal;vector quantization;contrastive predictive coding methods;feature extraction;computed VQ-CPC features;predicting function;mean-squared error;neural network;feature extractor;mutual information;ground truth scores","","","","39","IEEE","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Under the replica symmetry postulation, we prove that there exists a quantization scheme that attains this expression in the asymptotic regime of large system dimensions. In addition, we prove a converse demonstrating that the MMSE in estimating any fixed sub-block of the source from the quantized measurements at a fixed number of bits does not exceed this expression as the system dimensions go to infinity.

However, sEMG movement recognition has to deal with the long-term reliability of sEMG-based control, limited by the variability affecting the sEMG signal. Embedded solutions are affected by a recognition accuracy drop over time that makes them unsuitable for reliable gesture controller design. In this paper, we present a complete wearable-class embedded system for robust sEMG-based gesture recognition, based on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). Firstly, we developed a novel TCN topology (TEMPONet), and we tested our solution on a benchmark dataset (Ninapro), achieving 49.6% average accuracy, 7.8%, better than current State-Of-the-Art (SoA). Moreover, we designed an energy-efficient embedded platform based on GAP8, a novel 8-core IoT processor. Using our embedded platform, we collected a second 20-sessions dataset to validate the system on a setup which is representative of the final deployment. We obtain 93.7% average accuracy with the TCN, comparable with a SoA SVM approach (91.1%). Finally, we profiled the performance of the network implemented on GAP8 by using an 8-bit quantization strategy to fit the memory constraint of the processor. We reach a 4× lower memory footprint (460 kB) with a performance degradation of only 3% accuracy. We detailed the execution on the GAP8 platform, showing that the quantized network executes a single classification in 12.84 ms with a power envelope of 0.9 mJ, making it suitable for a long-lifetime wearable deployment.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2019.2959160","European H2020 FET project OPRECOMP(grant numbers:732631); EC Horizon-2020 ALOHA(grant numbers:780788); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930945","Convolutional neural networks;electromyography;multi-layer neural networks;neural network hardware;temporal convolutional networks","Convolution;Electromyography;Reliability;Real-time systems;Gesture recognition;Support vector machines;Prosthetics","biomechanics;convolutional neural nets;electromyography;embedded systems;gesture recognition;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;signal classification;support vector machines","TEMPONet;gesture controller design;TCN topology;SoA SVM;8-core IoT processor;sEMG-based gesture recognition;sEMG signal;sEMG movement recognition;human-computer interaction;surface electromyographic signal;hand movement classification;multicore IoT processor;temporal convolutional networks","Adult;Electromyography;Equipment Design;Gestures;Hand;Humans;Internet of Things;Male;Man-Machine Systems;Neural Networks, Computer;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","35","","58","IEEE","11 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is assumed that each scattered waveform must be quantized via an encoding procedure. A distortion D is defined as the error in estimating the underlying HMM states, and the rate R represents the size of the discrete-HMM codebook. Rate-distortion theory is applied to define the minimum rate required to achieve a desired distortion, denoted as R(D). After deriving the rate-distortion function R(D), we demonstrate that discrete-HMM performance based on Lloyd encoding is far from this bound. Performance is improved via block coding, based on Bayes VQ. Results are presented for a canonical HMM problem, and then for multiaspect acoustic scattering from underwater elastic targets.

Recently, deformable part-based model (DPM) is widely used. A DPM consists of a root node and a collection of part nodes, which is learned under the latent SVM formulation by treating part nodes as hidden variables. Although the configuration of parts (i.e., the shapes, sizes and locations of parts) plays a major role in improving performance of object detection, it has not been addressed well in the literature. In this paper, we propose RPM to tackle it. A dictionary of part types is defined by enumerating rectangular shapes of different aspect ratios and sizes given the whole lattice (often at twice resolution of the root node), and each part type has a set of part instances when placed in the lattice. So, the configuration space of parts is quantized by the part types and part instances, and then organized into a hierarchical And-Or directed a cyclic graph (AOG). The AOG consists of three types of nodes: terminal nodes (i.e., part instances), And-nodes (representing decompositions of a part instance into two smaller ones) and Or-nodes (representing alternative ways of decompositions). The globally optimal configuration in the AOG is solved using dynamic programming (DP) where the classification error rates of terminal nodes and And-nodes are used as their figures of merit. In experiments, we test our method on the 20 object categories in the PASCAL VOC2007 dataset and obtain comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods.","1945-788X","978-1-4673-1659-0","10.1109/ICME.2012.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298367","Deformable Part-based Model;Part Configuration;Latent SVM;Dynamic Programming","Lattices;Training;Deformable models;Object detection;Support vector machines;Error analysis;Shape","directed graphs;dynamic programming;error statistics;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;support vector machines","object detection;global part-based models learning;reconfigurable part-based models learning;RPM;deformable part-based model;DPM;root node;latent SVM formulation;rectangular shapes;configuration space;hierarchical And-Or directed acyclic graph;AOG;terminal nodes;And- nodes;Or-nodes;globally optimal configuration;dynamic programming;DP;classification error rates;PASCAL VOC2007 dataset;object categories","","4","1","12","","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, covering a considerable part of the face by the mask poses severe challenges for conventional face recognition systems. This paper proposes an automated Masked Face Recognition (MFR) system based on the combination of a mask occlusion discarding technique and a deep-learning model. Initially, a pre-processing step is carried out in which the images pass three filters. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed to extract the features from unoccluded regions of the faces (i.e., eyes and forehead). These feature maps are employed to obtain covariance-based features. Two extra layers, i.e., Bitmap and Eigenvalue, are designed to reduce the dimension and concatenate these covariance feature matrices. The deep covariance features are quantized to codebooks combined based on Bag-of-Features (BoF) paradigm. Finally, a global histogram is created based on these codebooks and utilized for training an SVM classifier. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on Real-World-Masked-Face-Recognition-Dataset (RMFRD) and Simulated-Masked-Face-Recognition-Dataset (SMFRD) achieves an accuracy of 95.07% and 92.32 %, respectively, showing its competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art.

To achieve such low bit rates, it is necessary to quantize the pitch and energy parameters at rates below 100 bits/sec. Contour quantization is introduced as a technique in which the contour of a given parameter is normalized by a nominal value and vector quantized. Contour quantization is shown to be extremely robust and efficient in encoding the pitch and energy parameters of the LPC vocoder. In this paper, a low rate speech coding system which uses contour quantization to encode the LPC excitation is presented. The system is a fixed bit rate system which is intended to operate at bit rates ranging from 400 bits/s to 800 bits/s. The overall system delay varies from 300 ms at 800 bits/s to 400 ms at 400 bits/s.

Assuming that the transmitter uses the quantized information for beamforming, we derive a universal lower bound on the outage probability for any finite set of beamformers. The universal lower bound provides a concise characterization of the gain with each additional bit of feedback information regarding the channel. Using the bound, it is shown that finite information systems approach the perfect information case as (t-1)2/sup -B/t-1/, where B is the number of feedback bits and t is the number of transmit antennas. The geometrical bounding technique, used in the proof of the lower bound, also leads to a design criterion for good beamformers, whose outage performance approaches the lower bound. The design criterion minimizes the maximum inner product between any two beamforming vectors in the beamformer codebook, and is equivalent to the problem of designing unitary space-time codes under certain conditions. Finally, we show that good beamformers are good packings of two-dimensional subspaces in a 2t-dimensional real Grassmannian manifold with chordal distance as the metric.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237136","","Array signal processing;Feedback;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Performance gain;Power control;Antenna feeds;Information systems;Telephone sets;Base stations","adaptive antenna arrays;array signal processing;transmitting antennas;quantisation (signal);feedback;probability;space-time codes","beamforming;finite rate feedback;multiple-antenna systems;transmitter;quantized information;instantaneous channel realizations;universal lower bound;outage probability;feedback information;finite information systems;perfect information;feedback bits;transmit antennas;geometrical bounding technique;design criterion;outage performance;maximum inner product;beamforming vectors;beamformer codebook;unitary space-time codes;real Grassmannian manifold;chordal distance","","703","17","23","","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When this knowledge is acquired through a quantized feedback scheme, its quality is roughly determined by the number of feedback bits. In this paper we investigate feedback optimization problems for the quantized feedback scheme via random vector quantization (RVQ) in a two-cell MIMO broadcast channel. Assuming each user knows its direct and interfering channel states perfectly, we address the following question: given a total number of feedback bits, how should a user allocate those bits to quantize its direct and cross channel information? We pose that question for different levels of BS cooperation, namely Network MIMO and Coordinated Beamforming (CBf). We focus on regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding structures and derive our results in the large system limit where the number of users and antennas per BS tend to infinity with their ratio being fixed. We show that for both cooperation schemes, each user should allocate more bits to quantize the cross channel as the latter's gain (ϵ) increases. We also show that, contrary to the full channel knowledge case, under this limited feedback scheme, for some values of (ϵ) no cooperation between the BSs is preferred.","2157-8117","978-1-4673-2579-0","10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6283034","","Interference;Signal to noise ratio;MIMO;Bit rate;Limiting;Base stations;Array signal processing","broadcast channels;cellular radio;cooperative communication;MIMO communication","base station cooperation;limited feedback;large system analysis;multicell network;quantized feedback scheme;random vector quantization;RVQ;two-cell MIMO broadcast channel;channel states;BS cooperation;network MIMO;coordinated beamforming;regularized zero-forcing precoding structures;CBf;channel knowledge","","3","","11","","27 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, an approach to SI estimation for WZ video coding is proposed. It is based on motion compensated temporal interpolation. In the approach, stationary areas are first identified by motion detection. Nearly textureless areas for which motion vectors can not be reliably estimated with smaller block size are also identified by the analysis of spatial intensity gradients. Based on the identification of such areas and on the matching errors of the estimated motion vectors, a variable size block based motion field is then estimated using a splitting strategy. Post-processing of the estimated motion vectors is also conducted to deal with blocks which may still contain more than one objects with different motion. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in the context of WZ video coding, and compared with some existing methods. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the propose approach.","","978-0-7695-3119-9","10.1109/CISP.2008.291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4566188","","Video coding;Decoding;Motion estimation;Video codecs;Source coding;Performance loss;Channel coding;Error correction codes;Parity check codes;Video signal processing","motion estimation;video coding","side information estimation;Wyner-Ziv video coding;lossy coding;decoder side information;quantized source decoding;motion compensated temporal interpolation;motion detection;motion vectors","","2","","18","","16 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system implemented is designed to take a sequence of images and to assign it to one of a number of discrete classes where each of them corresponds to a gesture from a predefined vocabulary. The classification task is broken down into an initial preprocessing stage following by a mapping from the preprocessed input variables to an output variable representing the class label. The preprocessing stage consists of the extraction of one translation and scale invariant feature vector from each image of the sequence. Further we utilize a hybrid combination of a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) and discrete hidden Markov models (DHMM) for mapping an ordered sequence of feature vectors to one gesture category. We create one DHMM for each movement to be detected. In the learning phase the SOM is used to cluster the feature vector space. After the self-organizing process each codebook is quantized into a symbol. Every symbol sequence underlying a given movement is finally used to train the corresponding Markov model by means of the nondiscriminative Baum-Welch algorithm, aiming at maximizing the probability of the samples given the model at hand. In the recognition phase the SOM transforms any input image sequence into one symbol sequence which is subsequently fed into a system of DHMMs. The gesture associated with the model which best matches the observed symbol sequence is chosen as the recognized movement.","","0-7695-0446-9","10.1109/ICIIS.1999.810286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=810286","","Vocabulary;Organizing;Character recognition;Input variables;Hidden Markov models;Clustering algorithms;Image recognition;Image sequences;Cameras;Real time systems","gesture recognition;image sequences;image classification;self-organising feature maps;hidden Markov models;feature extraction","hybrid stochastic-connectionist architecture;dynamic gesture recognition;image sequence;discrete classes;predefined vocabulary;initial preprocessing stage;preprocessed input variables;output variable;translation invariant feature vector;scale invariant feature vector;Kohonen self organizing map;discrete hidden Markov models;ordered feature vector sequence;learning phase;codebook quantization;symbol sequence;nondiscriminative Baum-Welch algorithm;probability;recognized movement","","3","","17","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some successful approaches have been presented for detecting double JPEG compression when the primary compression and the secondary compression have different quantization matrixes. However, when the primary compression and the secondary compression have the same quantization matrix, no detection method has been reported yet. In this paper, we present a method which can detect double JPEG compression with the same quantization matrix. Our algorithm is based on the observation that in the process of recompressing a JPEG image with the same quantization matrix over and over again, the number of different JPEG coefficients, i.e., the quantized discrete cosine transform coefficients between the sequential two versions will monotonically decrease in general. For example, the number of different JPEG coefficients between the singly and doubly compressed images is generally larger than the number of different JPEG coefficients between the corresponding doubly and triply compressed images. Via a novel random perturbation strategy implemented on the JPEG coefficients of the recompressed test image, we can find a “proper” randomly perturbed ratio. For different images, this universal “proper” ratio will generate a dynamically changed threshold, which can be utilized to discriminate the singly compressed image and doubly compressed image. Furthermore, our method has the potential to detect triple JPEG compression, four times JPEG compression, etc.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2072921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560817","Digital forensic;double joint photographic experts group (JPEG) compression;quantization matrix","Image coding;Transform coding;Quantization;Discrete cosine transforms;Image reconstruction;Decoding","computer forensics;data compression;discrete cosine transforms;image coding;matrix algebra;vector quantisation","double JPEG compression;quantization matrix;joint photographic expert group;digital forensics;JPEG image;quantized discrete cosine transform;random perturbation strategy","","132","","18","IEEE","2 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This scheme consists of a source-independent random codebook (typically mismatched to the source distribution), followed by optimal entropy coding that is matched to the quantized codeword distribution. A single-letter formula is derived for the rate achieved by this scheme at a given distortion, in the limit of large codebook dimension. The rate reduction due to entropy coding is quantified, and it is shown that it can be arbitrarily large. In the special case of ""almost uniform"" codebooks (e.g., an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian codebook with large variance) and difference distortion measures, a novel connection is drawn between the compression achieved by the present scheme and the performance of ""universal"" entropy-coded dithered lattice quantizers. This connection generalizes the ""half-a-bit"" bound on the redundancy of dithered lattice quantizers. Moreover, it demonstrates a strong notion of universality where a single ""almost uniform"" codebook is near optimal for any source and any difference distortion measure. The proofs are based on the fact that the limiting empirical distribution of the first matching codeword in a random codebook can be precisely identified. This is done using elaborate large deviations techniques, that allow the derivation of a new ""almost sure"" version of the conditional limit theorem.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2006.872845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624632","Data compression;large deviations;mismatch;pattern matching;random coding;rate-distortion theory;robustness;universal Gaussian codebook;universal quantization","Entropy coding;Data compression;Quantization;Lattices;Performance loss;Distortion measurement;Robustness;Performance analysis;Pattern matching;Rate-distortion","entropy codes;random codes;source coding;vector quantisation","mismatched codebook;lossy data compression;source-independent random codebook;quantized codeword distribution;entropy coded dithered lattice quantizer;empirical distribution","","13","","37","","24 Apr 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The extracted features are further used to learn a linear classifier (SVM) to detect a morphing attack based on the assessment of differences between the bona fide image from the ABC gate and the digital face image extracted from the passport. Owing to the availability of multiple cameras within an ABC gate, we extend the proposed method to fuse the classification scores to generate the final decision on morph-attack-detection.

However, these complicated quantizers introduce considerable computational overhead during inference since activation quantization should be conducted online. In this paper, we formulate the quantization process as a simple lookup operation and propose to learn lookup tables as quantizers. Specifically, we develop differentiable lookup tables and introduce several training strategies for optimization. Our lookup tables can be trained with the network in an end-to-end manner to fit the distributions in different layers and have very small additional computational cost.

The optimal, according to the above criterion, pyramidal coders are determined for images quantized using the optimal vector Lloyd-Max quantizers. A rigorous general statistical model of a vector Lloyd-Max quantizer is used, consisting of a linear time-invariant filter followed by additive noise uncorrelated with the input. Given arbitrary analysis filters, the optimal synthesis filters are found. The optimal analysis filters are subsequently determined, leading to formulas for globally optimal structures for pyramidal multidimensional signal decompositions. These structures produce replicas of the original image, which at lower resolutions retain as much similarity to the original as possible. This is highly useful for the progressive coding of two- or three-dimensional (2-D or 3-D) images needed in applications such as fast browsing through image databases. Furthermore, the minimization of the variance of the error image leads to minimization of the variance of the quantization noise for this image and, hence, to its optimally efficient compression. Experimental results illustrate the implementation and performance of the optimal pyramids in application for the coding of still 2-D images.","1941-0476","","10.1109/78.668556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=668556","","Multidimensional systems;Image coding;Signal resolution;Image resolution;Vectors;Nonlinear filters;Additive noise;Signal synthesis;Signal analysis;Image databases","image coding;quantisation (signal);image representation;image resolution;statistical analysis;band-pass filters;noise;signal synthesis;filtering theory;circuit optimisation;data compression","optimal pyramidal decomposition;progressive multidimensional signal coding;optimal quantizers;optimal hierarchical coding;scalable multidimensional signal transmission;progressive multidimensional signal transmission;error variance minimisation;image resolution;pyramidal coders;optimal vector Lloyd-Max quantizers;statistical model;linear time-invariant filter;additive noise;image database browsing;optimal synthesis filters;optimal analysis filters;quantization noise;image compression;experimental results;still 2D images;multiresolution data representation;pyramidal filter bank","","9","","40","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a common understanding that the feedback quantized by the codebook limits the performance of MU-MIMO. In this paper, through a quasi-ZF or a quasi-Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) weight, the channel matrix is transferred to one of the codebook vectors, based on which, the CSI is calculated. Thus, the quantization error is minimized. Meanwhile, the selection for the codebook vector guarantees the maximizing of the estimated Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). We verify that the proposed scheme obtains accurate feedback information, and the predicted weight can be the same as the optimal linear decoder as if the receiver knew all the precoder information that is fed-forward from the BS, as long as the number of antennas for each receiver equals that for the transmitter, and equals that for the total transmit data streams. Compared to the commonly used Precoding Matrix Index (PMI) based method, which uses rank-one single user (SU)-MIMO feedback, simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve higher sum capacities in different scenarios. Moreover, since the weight can be directly used as the decoder, the feed-forward overhead is reduced.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.030413.120051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6485024","MU-MIMO;broadcast channels;feedback","Vectors;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Receivers;Decoding;Quantization (signal);Downlink","decoding;feedback;linear codes;mean square error methods;MIMO communication;precoding;quantisation (signal);radio links;radio receivers;radio transmitters;wireless channels","DL MU-MIMO ZF precoding;limited-feedback channel state information;CSI;zero forcing;ZF-precoded downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system;MU-MIMO system;feedback quantization;MU-MIMO performance;quasiZF;quasiminimum mean-squared error;MMSE weight;channel matrix;codebook vector selection;quantization error;signal to interference plus noise ratio;SINR;feedback information;optimal linear decoder;receiver;transmitter;total transmit data streams;precoding matrix index;PMI;rank-one single user;SU-MIMO feedback;sum capacities;feed-forward overhead","","7","","18","","22 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For sensing applications, however, the objective is often not simply signal reconstruction but classification performance as well. Other related metrics include target-pose estimation. We consider multiaspect wave scattering, in which classification and pose estimation are performed based on the quantized scattering data. Moreover, rate-distortion theory is employed to place bounds on pose-estimation performance when both the target identity and pose are unknown a priori.

We start this process by generating spin images on meshes. These local shape descriptors are then quantized via k-means clustering. The key contribution of this paper is to represent a global 3D shape as the spatial configuration of a set of specific local shapes. We achieve this goal by computing the distributions of the Euclidean distance of pairs of local shape clusters. Because of the spatial, sparse distribution of local shapes defined over a 3D model, an indexing data structure is adopted to reduce the space complexity of the proposed shape descriptor. The technical merits of our new approach are at least two-fold: (1) it is robust to non-trivial shape occlusions and deformations, since there are statistically a large number of chances that some local shape signatures and their spatial layouts are unchanged and users can easily identify those unchanged parts; (2) it is more discriminative than a simple collection of local shape signatures, since the spatial layouts of a global shape are explicitly computed.

The encoding system consists of a number of CELP coders with different linear predictive coding parameter quantization patterns, code book sizes, and population densities. The selection of the encoding state for each input vector depends on the input signal characteristics, the desired bit rate/signal to quantized noise ratio, and the current state of the encoder. In CELP coders the greater part of the bit resources, about 70%, is used for encoding of the excitation signal. However, the excitation accuracy needed to encode a speech segment with a desired level of fidelity strongly depends on its short-term spectral characteristics. The use of a finite-state system involves some implicit clustering of speech and allows variable-rate coding of the excitation. The gain in compression that can be obtained from variable-rate coding of the excitation signal is investigated.

We describe in this paper the use of a variable order Markov chain that maximizes the effective use of a given amount of speech data. To reduce the number of states of a high-order chain, we define an equivalence relation on the states, i.e., ""similar"" states are grouped together in an equivalence class and a single conditional distribution is associated with the equivalence class. We introduce two equivalence relations. In the first, called variable order Markov chain, the equivalence classes represent the most probable states of any order. In the second method, called variable resolution, the equivalence class is obtained by decreasing the quantization accuracy in representing a spectrum that belongs to a more remote past. For an LPC vocoder with 64 possible spectra (using 6-bit vector quantization), the second method is superior to the first and decreases the entropy from 6 bits to 4 bits per spectrum with 256 equivalence classes.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.1982.1171652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1171652","","Speech coding;Bit rate;Vocoders;Linear predictive coding;Entropy;Encoding;Vector quantization;Fasteners;Timing;Training data","","","","7","","4","","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We focus on asymmetric fading sensor networks in which the sensors have differing signal to noise ratios and transmission powers. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for the achievability of (L + 1)-tuples (P1, P2, ..., PL, D).

The idea is based on a new geometrical image transform called 2-D elliptical-support wavelet transform (2-D ESWT). A five-level 2-D elliptical-support wavelet decomposition is needed to form a reduced fixed length quantized feature vector with improved performance.

The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a solution to leverage the spatial multiplexing gain by utilizing a number of antennas distributed in a certain area. However, in most of the current literature, due to the limited front-haul capacity, each remote radio head (RRH) can use only a single antenna, and thus the total number of antennas can be utilized are limited. In this work, we propose a distributed baseband signal compressive quantization scheme for the uplink of a multi-antenna C-RAN where each RRH uses multiple antennas. At each RRH, the baseband signals of multiple time instants are embedded into a vector with low dimension using delay-and-add so that more bits can be allocated to each value, and the quantization noise power caused by the front-haul link capacity deficit is reduced. The delay-and-add operation is low complexity that can be realized using basic buffering and adding, and it does not require channel information in the RRHs. Therefore, the low deployment cost feature of C-RAN is preserved. As a result, a large number of antennas can be utilized by deploying a lot of multi-antenna RRHs, which provide rich spatial diversity that assists the detection which happens in the baseband units. In the symbol detection phase, the corresponding weight vectors are designed to detect the symbols from the compressive quantized baseband signal. A parallel interference cancellation algorithm is proposed to further improve the accuracy of the symbol detection. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is efficient in tackling the front-haul capacity challenge. We also apply the proposed scheme to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based multi-antenna C-RAN, where we find that the system can utilize larger bandwidth with limited front-haul capacity. It facilitates the deployment of C-RAN based on both 4G and 5G wireless communications.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2826545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8337794","Interference suppression;broadband communication;least mean square methods;antenna arrays;MIMO;data compression;quantization","Quantization (signal);Antennas;Baseband;Uplink;MIMO communication;Spatial diversity","cloud computing;interference suppression;OFDM modulation;quantisation (signal);radio access networks;radiofrequency interference;space division multiplexing","weight vectors;delay-and-add operation;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based multi-antenn C-RAN;front-haul link capacity deficit;quantization noise power;multiple time instants;baseband signals;distributed baseband signal compressive quantization scheme;RRH;remote radio head;spatial multiplexing gain;revolutionary wireless communication techniques;wireless traffic;cloud radio access network;distributed signal compressive quantization;front-haul capacity challenge;parallel interference cancellation algorithm;compressive quantized baseband signal;symbol detection phase;baseband units;rich spatial diversity;low deployment cost feature","","4","","33","IEEE","13 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, the host signal is first transformed into the logarithmic domain using the ¿ -Law compression function. Then, the transformed data is quantized uniformly and the result is transformed back to the original domain using the inverse function. The scalar method is then extended to vector quantization. For this, the magnitude of each host vector is quantized on the surface of hyperspheres which follow logarithmic radii. Optimum parameter ¿ for both scalar and vector cases is calculated according to the host signal distribution. Moreover, inclusion of a secret key in the proposed method, similar to the dither modulation in QIM, is introduced. Performance of the proposed method in both cases is analyzed and the analytical derivations are verified through extensive simulations on artificial signals. The method is also simulated on real images and its performance is compared with previous scalar and vector quantization-based methods.

In contrast to previous approaches, we make the model assembly a part of the training process driven by samples drawn from the corresponding cover- and stego-sources. Ensemble classifiers are used to assemble the model as well as the final steganalyzer due to their low computational complexity and ability to efficiently work with high-dimensional feature spaces and large training sets. We demonstrate the proposed framework on three steganographic algorithms designed to hide messages in images represented in the spatial domain: HUGO, edge-adaptive algorithm by Luo   , and optimally coded ternary $\pm {\hbox{1}}$ embedding. For each algorithm, we apply a simple submodel-selection technique to increase the detection accuracy per model dimensionality and show how the detection saturates with increasing complexity of the rich model.

An adaptive statistical test is designed such that its probability distribution is always independent of the unknown image parameters, while ensuring a high probability of hidden bits detection. This test is based on the likelihood ratio test except that the unknown parameters are replaced by estimates based on a local linear regression model. It is shown that this test maximizes the probability of detection as the image size becomes arbitrarily large and the quantization step vanishes.

The proposed method relies on a locality sensitive hashing scheme based on a secure binary embedding, computed using quantized random projections. Hashes extracted from the signals preserve information about the distance between the signals, provided this distance is small enough. If the distance between the signals is larger than a threshold, then no information about the distance is revealed. Theoretical and experimental justification is provided for this property. Further, when the randomized embedding parameters are unknown, then the mutual information between the hashes of any two signals decays to zero exponentially fast as a function of the ℓ2 distance between the signals. Taking advantage of this property, we suggest that these binary hashes can be used to perform privacy-preserving nearest neighbor search with significantly lower complexity compared to protocols which use the actual signals.","2157-4774","978-1-4577-1019-3","10.1109/WIFS.2011.6123149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6123149","","Servers;Vectors;Protocols;Quantization;Cryptography;Authentication;Databases","approximation theory;cryptography;data privacy;pattern clustering","binary embedding security;privacy preserving nearest neighbor;nearest neighbor clustering approximation;locality sensitive hashing scheme;quantized random projection;hashes extraction;information preservation;binary hashes;privacy-preserving nearest neighbor search","","36","","15","","5 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, product quantization that encodes the cluster index in each subspace has been shown to provide impressive accuracy for nearest neighbor search. In this paper, we explore a simple question: is it best to use all the bit budget for encoding a cluster index in each subspace? We have found that as data points are located farther away from the centers of their clusters, the error of estimated distances among those points becomes larger. To address this issue, we propose a novel encoding scheme that distributes the available bit budget to encoding both the cluster index and the quantized distance between a point and its cluster center. We also propose two different distance metrics tailored to our encoding scheme. We have tested our method against the-state-of-the-art techniques on several well-known benchmarks, and found that our method consistently improves the accuracy over other tested methods. This result is achieved mainly because our method accurately estimates distances between two data points with the new binary codes and distance metric.","1063-6919","978-1-4799-5118-5","10.1109/CVPR.2014.274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909671","Large-scale search;image retrieval;binary code","Quantization (signal);Encoding;Binary codes;Measurement;Indexes;Accuracy;Vectors","binary codes;computer vision;image coding;quantisation (signal)","distance encoded product quantization;binary code embedding techniques;large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search;computer vision;cluster index encoding;quantized distance metrics;data points","","30","","22","","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spatial multiplexing is of practical importance because the multiple substreams can be decoded using linear receivers. Unfortunately, this reduction in complexity degrades the probability of error performance. To overcome this difficulty, error rate performance of spatial multiplexing systems can be improved by sending fewer substreams than the number of transmit antennas by linear preceding. Criteria have been proposed for designing these precoders when complete channel knowledge is available to the transmitter. The assumption of complete channel knowledge is often unrealistic in many communication systems such as those with low rate feedback channels. Thus a quantized preceding scheme is proposed where the receiver sends back a fixed number of bits to the transmitter. This bit pattern corresponds to an index within a finite set of preceding matrices. A previously proposed criterion is used to determine the matrix in this precoder codebook to choose. A design method for these codebooks using techniques from Grassmannian subspace packing is presented. Simulation results show this technique outperforms typical antenna selection.","","0-7803-8140-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290176","","Feedback;MIMO;Transmitters;Maximum likelihood decoding;Transmitting antennas;Array signal processing;Vectors;Resistance heating;Heat engines;Degradation","MIMO systems;demultiplexing;transmitting antennas;feedback;Monte Carlo methods;decoding;linear codes;telecommunication channels;quantisation (signal)","feedback precoding;spatial multiplexing systems;linear receivers;multiple-input multiple-output;spatial multiplexing wireless systems;demultiplexing;bit stream;multiple substreams;error rate performance;transmit antennas;communication systems;feedback channels;quantized preceding scheme;precoder codebook;Grassmannian subspace packing","","29","18","21","","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is a mixed integer programming problem where the optimum precoders should be obtained at the transmitters and the network equation coefficients have to be computed at the relays. To solve this problem, we introduce phase precoded CoF with partial feedback. It is a quantized precoding system where the relay jointly computes both a quasi-optimal precoder from a finite codebook and the corresponding network equations. The index of the obtained phase precoder within the codebook will then be fedback to the transmitters. A “deep hole phase precoder” is presented as an example of such a scheme.

Since the optimal solution would require high complexity, we investigate a new low-complexity algorithm that selects the best users and their beamforming strategies in terms of maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR). To this end, we first develop a simple threshold criterion for each user to decide the preferred beamforming strategy based on the derivation of the expected signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Then, according to users' feedback about their decisions, a successive user and beamforming selection algorithm is performed at the BSs. From simulation results, we show that, combined with proportional fair scheduling, the proposed scheme provides excellent throughput performance with very low computational complexity and the amount of inter-BS CSI exchange.

A face recognition system aims at recognizing a face in a manner that is as independent as possible of these image variations. Such variations make face recognition, on the basis of appearance, a difficult task. This paper attempts to overcome the variations of facial expression and proposes a biological vision-based facial description, namely Perceived Facial Images (PFIs), applied to facial images for 2D face recognition. Based on the intermediate facial description, SIFT-based feature matching is then carried out to calculate similarity measures between a given probe face and the gallery ones. Because the proposed biological vision-based facial description generates a PFI for each quantized gradient orientation of facial images, we further propose a weighted sum rule based fusion scheme. The proposed approach was tested on three facial expression databases: the Cohn and Kanade Facial Expression Database, the Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) Database and the FEEDTUM Database.

The challenge of designing ZFBF in cognitive networks lies in how to obtain the interference CSI. To solve it, we introduce a limited internetwork cooperation protocol, namely, the quantized CSI conveyance from the primary receiver to the cognitive BS via purchase. Clearly, the more the feedback amount, the better the performance, but the higher the feedback cost. To achieve a balance between the performance and feedback cost, we take the maximization of the feedback utility function (FUF), which is defined as the difference of the average sum rate and feedback cost while satisfying the interference constraint, as the optimization objective, and derive the transmission mode and feedback amount joint optimization scheme. Moreover, we quantitatively investigate the impact of CSI feedback delay and obtain the corresponding optimization scheme. Furthermore, through asymptotic analysis, we present some simple schemes.

Although efficient, precise channel information is needed in order to minimize the possible interferences. Motivated by its importance, the study investigates interference management in multi-user downlink systems under heterogeneous feedback of channel state information to the transmitter (CSIT). In the considered scenario, the base station (BS) can obtain different levels of channel realization information from the users under multi-user transmission. In particular we focus on a generic scenario with two user equipments (UEs), one (UE-1) being able to provide a perfect CSIT to the BS and the other (UE-2) unable to, where an effective transmission strategy at the BS is proposed with the premise of mitigating interference at UE-1. Unfortunately the absence of CSIT for UE-2 pushes it in interference-limited regime. To this end, two approaches are considered in the study: one by developing additional spatial diversity, and the other via advanced receiver design at UE-2. We investigate both of the options and show that the rate of UE-2 gets significantly improved in both cases. However hardware and RF design constraints may make the advanced receiver design solution preferable over the spatial diversity solution. We then put this heterogeneous CSIT feedback system in the context of long term evolution (LTE) of third generation partnership project (3GPP) where interference cannot be nulled out even for UE-1 due to the feedback of low level quantized CSIT and the restriction of the use of a very limited set of beamformers. The paper demonstrates that the advanced interference-aware receiver design can bring significant gains in the considered scenario, thereby underlining the necessity of intelligent receiver-processing in modern wireless systems.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2012.122212.120354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6410079","Heterogeneous CSIT feedback;interference-aware receiver;interference mitigation;max log MAP detection;pairwise error probability;spatial diversity","Interference;Vectors;Spatial diversity;Receiving antennas;Fading","3G mobile communication;array signal processing;feedback;interference suppression;Long Term Evolution;quantisation (signal);space division multiplexing","interference management;multiuser transmission;spatial multiplexing;wireless systems;resource block;channel information;multiuser downlink systems;channel state information-transmitter;base station;BS;channel realization information;interference mitigation;RF design constraints;spatial diversity solution;heterogeneous CSIT feedback system;Long Term Evolution;LTE;third generation partnership project;3GPP;low level quantized CSIT;beamformers;advanced interference-aware receiver design;intelligent receiver-processing","","3","","24","","11 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we consider models where N covariates X = (X1,...,XN) along with outcome Y are observed, with the assumption that the outcome Y is conditionally independent of the other covariates given K ≪ N covariates. Using asymptotic information theoretic analyses, we establish sufficient conditions on the number of samples in order to successfully recover the K salient covariates. We apply our results to two variants of the compressive sensing (CS) problem: (1) compressive sensing with a measurement noise model, (2) 1-bit quantized compressive sensing. In both models we consider sensing with independent and correlated Gaussian sensing matrices.

In this paper, under the framework of GPC, we propose a novel transmit beamforming scheme to account for the feedback delay. By designing a new prediction based quantization function and optimizing the prediction, the forthcoming CDI can be accurately tracked.

However, for a specific recognition application such several scene types, some quantized colors maybe never appear in any scene image, and at the same time the detail variation in other quantized colors include much discriminative features. Therefore, this study proposes to characterize the color information of scene images using a leaning strategy for producing adaptive color level, and extract the histogram of the learned color levels for image representation.

To provide a short delay and high quality under both error-free and channel error conditions, it uses three new schemes: line spectrum pair (LSP) quantization using interframe prediction, preselection in the codebook search, and gain vector quantization (VQ) with backward prediction. The LSP parameters are quantized by using multistage VQ with moving-average (MA) prediction. This scheme can operate efficiently with various frequency responses of speech. The preselection of the codebook reduces the computational complexity and improves the robustness to channel errors. The gain VQ with backward prediction can provide a high quality and robustness without transmission of input speech power information. A conjugate structure for both random codebook and gain codebook is introduced to improve the ability to handle random bit errors and to reduce codebook storage memory requirements. Subjective testing indicates that the quality of this coder is equivalent to that of 32-kb/s adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) under error-free conditions. Testing has further demonstrated that the coder is robust against random bit errors.","1558-2353","","10.1109/89.544525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=544525","","Speech coding;Linear predictive coding;Speech analysis;Robustness;Testing;Pulse modulation;North America;Delay;Personal communication networks;Decoding","speech coding;linear predictive coding;spectral analysis;vector quantisation;telecommunication channels;coding errors;moving average processes","conjugate structure CELP;CS-CELP speech coder;code-excited linear prediction;frame length;delay;error-free conditions;channel error conditions;line spectrum pair;LSP quantization;interframe prediction;codebook search preselection;gain vector quantization;moving-average prediction;backward prediction;LSP parameters;multistage VQ;frequency responses;computational complexity;random codebook;gain codebook;subjective testing;codebook storage memory;random bit errors;ADPCM;8 kbit/s","","15","15","43","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve this problem, a descriptor, namely directional pair-wise feature (DPF), is proposed to encode the mutual direction information between pairwise words, aiming at adding more spatial discriminant to BoVW. Firstly, STIP features are extracted and classified into a set of labeled words. Then in each frame, the DPF is constructed for every pair of words with different labels, according to their assigned directional vector. Finally, DPFs are quantized to be a probability histogram as a representation of human action.

In this paper, we propose a cloud storage system that reduces the storage cost of all uploaded JPEG photos, at the expense of a controlled increase in computation mainly during download of requested image subset. Specifically, the system first selectively re-encodes code blocks of uploaded JPEG images using coarser quantization parameters for smaller storage sizes. Then during download, the system exploits known signal priors - sparsity prior and graph-signal smoothness prior - for reverse mapping to recover original fine quantization bin indices, with either deterministic guarantee (lossless mode) or statistical guarantee (near-lossless mode). For fast reverse mapping, we use small dictionaries and sparse graphs that are tailored for specific clusters of similar blocks, which are classified via tree-structured vector quantizer. During image upload, cluster indices identifying the appropriate dictionaries and graphs for the re-quantized blocks are encoded as side information using a differential distributed source coding scheme to facilitate reverse mapping during image download.

However, it is often impractical to presume accurate knowledge of the basis, which motivates data-driven dictionary learning. Moreover, in large-scale settings one may only afford to acquire quantized measurements, which may arrive sequentially in a streaming fashion. The present paper jointly learns the sparse signal representation and the unknown dictionary when only binary streaming measurements with possible misses are available. To this end, a novel efficient online estimator with closed-form sequential updates is put forth to recover the sparse representation, while refining the dictionary `on the fly'.

For multiuser systems with matched-filter precoding, we show that the number of feedback bits required by the random vector quantization codebook to match even a small fraction of the perfect-CDI signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio performance is large. With such large numbers of bits, the exhaustive search required by conventional codebook approaches makes them infeasible for massive MISO systems. Motivated by this, we propose a differential TCQ scheme for temporally correlated channels that transforms the source constellation at each stage in a trellis using 2-D translation and scaling techniques. We derive a scaling parameter for the source constellation as a function of the temporal correlation and the number of base station antennas. We also propose a TCQ-based limited-feedback scheme for spatially correlated channels, where the channel is directly quantized without performing decorrelation at the receiver.

Most existing hash methods directly utilize a vector, which can be piped by the column of image matrix, as a unit and adopt some feature extraction functions to project the original data into generally shorter fixed-length values or characters. Then each of these projected real values is quantized or hashed into zero-one bit by a thresholding, such as locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and principal component analysis hashing (PCAH). However, the plain elongation of images may cause the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, different with PCAH method, the two dimensional (2D) images are directly used to extract the feature by two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) and 2DPCAH performs hashing using these 2DPCA-extracted data. Furthermore, starting with 2DPCA-extracted data, we apply iterative quantization (ITQ) technique, which aims to finding a rotation matrix so as to minimize the quantization error of mapping these data to a zero-centered binary hypercube.

We then propose a new scheduling scheme, namely modified CQI (MCQI), by which the quantization error is effectively incorporated in the scheduling. Further we obtain the capacity of MCQI-based scheduling. Simulation results confirm our analysis and show that the proposed MCQI-based scheduling improves the capacity compared to the CQI-based scheduling and Aloha. It is also seen that the performance boost is more significant where the feedback capacity is low and the network is dense. In comparison with the case of high feedback capacity, the network capacity is not reduced by low feedback capacity in the MCQI-based scheduling. This is of practical importance since the network designer can save the feedback resources by employing MCQI-based scheduling without compromising the capacity and increasing the receivers' complexity.","","978-1-5090-1328-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841830","","Receivers;Quantization (signal);Transceivers;Ad hoc networks;Array signal processing;Transmitting antennas","ad hoc networks;error analysis;interference (signal);telecommunication scheduling;vector quantisation","quantization uncertainty;capacity enhancement;limited-feedback MISO ad hoc network;random wireless network capacity;multiantennas;channel direction information;CDI;single antenna receivers;stochastic geometry;random vector quantization;quantization errors;interference;Aloha;modified channel quality information;MCQI-based scheduling;feedback capacity","","","","15","","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This feature is useful in bit depth conversion for modern high bit depth images and is also useful in visually lossless compression. Moreover, by taking into account color histogram sparseness in which a few colors among huge possible colors are used, lossless quantization with a reasonable processing time is served by the proposed method, whereas the conventional vector quantization requires numerous processing time for lossless quantization.","","978-1-4673-5082-2","10.1109/ISPACS.2012.6473536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6473536","Non-separable quantization;color reduction;high quality images;high bit depth images;high dynamic range images","Quantization;Image color analysis;Histograms;Color;Bit rate;Communication systems;Artificial intelligence","image coding;image colour analysis;vector quantisation","nonseparable weighted median-cut quantization;nonseparable color reduction;color image;bit rate quantization;bits per pixel;bpp;image quantization;quantization error;bit depth conversion;bit depth image;visually lossless compression;sparse color histogram;lossless quantization;vector quantization","","","1","8","","7 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the advantages of digital communications, and the trend towards it, it is desirable to develop a cost effective digital codec for HDTV signals. One of the criteria in the transmission of digital signals via satellites is the transmission bandwidth which dictates the transmission costs. Apart from development of good compression schemes, due consideration should also be given to the ease of hardware implementation, which is crucial in deciding factors like processing delay and the level of encoder/decoder complexity. With the above mentioned factors in mind a cost-effective HDTV codec is proposed. Few US organizations have addressed the problem of HDTV distribution via communication satellites. The majority of efforts in the development of an HDTV codec have been aimed at the 100 to 140 Mbits/sec data rate. To facilitate cost effective satellite transmission, the DS3 rate of 45 Mbits/sec, is desirable. The purpose of the present research is to compress the HDTV signals to around 20 Mbits/sec so that 2 HDTV channels can be transmitted through the DS3 rate channel. To achieve this degree of compression a new scheme is proposed. First subband coding is used to decompose the image into different frequency bands. Next motion compensation is applied to the low band, and the resulting interframe difference is discrete cosine transform (DCT) coded. The high bands are also DCT coded. The DCT coefficients of the difference signal of the low band and the DCT coefficients of the high band are then vector quantized.<>","","0-8186-5637-9","10.1109/DCC.1994.305927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=305927","","HDTV;Discrete cosine transforms;Costs;Codecs;Image coding;Satellites;Visual communication;Digital communication;Bandwidth;Hardware","high definition television;video signals;motion estimation;parameter estimation;encoding;image coding;vector quantisation;codecs;video equipment;self-organising feature maps;direct broadcasting by satellite;digital communication systems","low bit-rate transmission;HDTV signals;motion compensated subband transform coding;self-organization neural network;visual communications;digital communications;digital codec;compression schemes;processing delay;encoder/decoder complexity;cost-effective HDTV codec;communication satellites;satellite transmission;DS3 rate;interframe difference;discrete cosine transform;vector quantization;20 Mbit/s","","","","23","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since in practice channel knowledge at the transmitter is difficult to realize, we propose a technique where the receiver designs the beamforming vector and sends it to the transmitter by transmitting a label in a finite set, or codebook, of beamforming vectors. A codebook design method for quantized versions of maximum ratio transmission, equal gain transmission, and generalized selection diversity with maximum ratio combining at the receiver is presented. The codebook design criterion exploits the quantization problem's relationship with Grassmannian line packing. Systems using the beamforming codebooks are shown to have a diversity order of the product of the number of transmit and the number of receive antennas.

First a set of Haar features are computed and individual pixel responses are normalized to L2 unit length. Thereafter features are pooled over a predefined neighborhood region. The concatenation of several such features form the basis DIRD vector. These features are then quantized to maximize entropy allowing (among others) a binary version of DIRD consisting of only ones and zeros for very fast matching. We evaluate DIRD on three test sets and compare its performance with (extended) USURF, BRIEF and a baseline gray level descriptor.

The feedback channel from the decoder to the encoder is assumed noiseless. Since the forward channel is digital, we need to employ quantization. We combine two techniques to enhance the reliability of the system. First, in order to guarantee that the system remains stable during packet dropouts and delays, we transmit quantized control vectors containing current control values for the decoder as well as future predicted control values. Second, we utilize multiple description coding based on forward error correction codes to further aid in the robustness towards packet erasures. In particular, we transmit M redundant packets, which are constructed such that when receiving any J packets, the current control signal as well as J-1 future control signals can be reliably reconstructed at the decoder.

Authentication systems built on only one biometric modality may not fulfill the requirements of demanding applications in terms of properties such as performance, acceptability and distinctiveness. Most of the unimodal biometrics systems have problems such as noise in collected data, intra-class variations, inter-class variations, non universality etc. Some of these limitations can be overcome by multiple source of information for establishing identity; such systems are known as multimodal biometric systems. In this paper a multi modal biometric system of iris and palm print based on Wavelet Packet Analysis is described. The most unique phenotypic feature visible in a person's face is the detailed texture of each eye's iris. Palm is the inner surface of a hand between the wrist and the fingers. Palmprint is referred to principal lines, wrinkles and ridges on the palm. The visible texture of a person's iris and palm print is encoded into a compact sequence of 2-D wavelet packet coefficients, which generate a “feature vector code”. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-resolution approach based on Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) for texture analysis and recognition of iris and palmprint. The development of this approach is motivated by the observation that dominant frequencies of iris texture are located in the low and middle frequency channels. With an adaptive threshold, WPT sub images coefficients are quantized into 1, 0 or -1 as iris signature. This signature presents the local information of different irises. By using wavelet packets the size of the biometric signature of code attained is 960 bits. The signature of the new pattern is compared against the stored pattern after computing the signature of new input pattern. Identification is performed by computing the hamming distance.","","978-81-909042-2-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215994","Biometric;iris pattern;palm print;multimodal;wavelet packet transform;score level fusion","Iris recognition;Image recognition;Data mining;Bioinformatics;High definition video;Vectors","feature extraction;image resolution;image texture;iris recognition;palmprint recognition;wavelet transforms","multimodal biometric recognition;iris feature extraction;palmprint features;pattern recognition system;biometric traits;authentication system;biometric modality;unimodal biometrics systems;wavelet packet analysis;iris texture;wrinkles;ridges;visible texture;palmprint texture;2D wavelet packet coefficients;feature vector code generation;multiresolution approach;wavelet packet transform;texture analysis;iris recognition;palmprint recognition;low frequency channels;middle frequency channels;adaptive threshold;WPT subimage coefficients;iris signature;local information;hamming distance","","2","","11","","14 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For designing the transmit beamforming vector of the information signal and precoding matrix of AN, Bob feeds back the quantized CSI estimation to Alice. Due to the effects of imperfect CSI at Alice, the secrecy system performance is upper bounded at high SNRs. In order to overcome the problem, by utilizing our derived upper bound on the secrecy rate loss, we put forward a scaled feedback strategy for the secrecy system. By employing the proposed strategy, the secrecy rate increases with transmit power despite that Alice can only obtain imperfect Bob's CSI, and the secrecy rate loss between perfect CSI and imperfect CSI can be controlled within a certain gap.

One of the challenges in downlink (DL) SDMA is obtaining adequate channel state information at the base-station (BS) transmitter to minimize multi user interference (MUI). MUI minimization requires the BS to acquire accurate channel state information respective to the mobiles, achieved in the form of feedback. Digital feedback is usually made of a quantized version of either the channel matrix or the singular vectors. Naturally, finer quantization leads to more accurate channel state information and less MUI, but also to higher feedback capacity. Minimizing MUI is especially important when the number of transmitted SDMA streams is larger than the number of receive antennas at the mobiles, for example when a BS transmits M SDMA streams to M mobiles, each endowed with a single receive antenna. Here the mobiles do not have enough degrees of freedom to suppress the MUI, for example through an MMSE receiver (which would be possible if each mobile had at least M receive antennas). In this paper we propose MIMO-like ML detection of all M SDMA information streams at each of the mobiles (each is endowed with a single antenna). Here each mobile discards all the irrelevant streams, targeting other mobiles, post ML detection. Although counter-intuitive, when the optimal nonlinear ML detector is employed, the standard requirement of N ≥ M receive antennas for spatial multiplexing detection is essentially eliminated. This approach is immediately extended to the case of N <; M receive antennas at the mobile, where N is not necessarily 1. The proposed method significantly outperforms standard detectors in the regime of high MUI due to insufficient feedback quantization. Thus, it paves the way to a significant decrease in feedback capacity and relaxed SDMA group selection.","","978-1-4673-4681-8","10.1109/EEEI.2012.6376929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6376929","SDMA;Low rate feedback;Group selection;Multi user interference","Multiaccess communication;Detectors;Vectors;MIMO;Joints;Mobile communication;Bit error rate","4G mobile communication;antenna arrays;interference suppression;matrix algebra;MIMO communication;radio receivers;radio transmitters;receiving antennas;space division multiple access;wireless channels","low feedback downlink SDMA;single antenna MIMO-like detection;space division multiple access;4G spectral efficiency;LTE;IEEE802.11ac;channel state information;base-station transmitter;BS transmitter;multiuser interference minimization;MUI minimization;digital feedback;singular vectors;channel matrix;feedback capacity;transmitted SDMA streams;single receive antenna;MUI suppression;MMSE receiver;least M receive antennas;M SDMA information streams;ML detection;counter-intuitive;optimal nonlinear ML detector;spatial multiplexing detection;insufficient feedback quantization;relaxed SDMA group selection","","","","12","","10 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve high-quality for two types of speech (IRS and non-IRS (flat) speech) and real-time implementation, CS-CELP has been revised by two novel schemes. To handle two types of speech, the LSP parameters are quantized by multistage VQ with fourth-order interframe MA prediction. This scheme has little spectrum distortion, even if the two types of speech have many variations of the LSP parameters. The computational complexity of the implementation is reduced for adaptive and fixed-shape codebooks without degrading the speech quality. Multistage selection is adopted in the adaptive codebook; this selection uses a truncated impulse response. Improved pre-selection is proposed in the fixed-shape codebook. Subjective testing indicates that the quality of CS-CELP is equivalent to that of the 32-kbit/s ADPCM under error-free conditions for IRS and non-IRS speech.

Each combination of macroblock class and quantization parameter is mapped to a nonlinear estimate which is designed either online or online from empirical data. The quantization parameters of macroblocks of a frame are determined to attain near uniform spatial reconstruction quality as the total estimate of the number of coding bits closely approximates the targeted number of bits for the frame satisfying the delay and encoder buffer size constraints.

The proposed codec operates on the speech frame of 20 ms at a sampling rate of 8 kHz. Also we introduce an efficient voicing detection algorithm using both frame energy and acoustic parameters to detect the voiced, unvoiced and silence region. 4 kb/s speech codec for the voiced region uses the generalized AbS structure which is efficient for the low bit rate speech codec. The generalized AbS structure is used for the relaxed CELP (RCELP) and it can reduce the bitrate for the pitch information by linear interpolation of the pitch delay. LP coefficients are converted to line spectrum pairs (LSP) and quantized using a predictive 2-stage VQ. A low complexity algebraic codebook which uses a shifting method is used for the fixed codebook excitation. 4 kb/s speech codec for the unvoiced region is same as that for the voiced region, except that the latter uses an open loop pitch lag in the whole frame. Also 1 kb/s codec is designed for the silence and background noise region. Experiments show that the variable half rate codec provides the average bit rate of about 2.63 kb/s for the test sentences whose voice activity factor (VAF) is 0.47.

We demonstrate that the estimation errors decrease as the SOM training proceeds, allowing the VQTAM scheme to be understood as a self-supervised gradient-based error reduction method. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a variety of complex tasks, namely: i) time series prediction; ii) identification of SISO/MIMO systems; and iii) nonlinear predictive control. For all tasks, the simulation results produced by the SOM are as accurate as those produced by the MLP network, and better than those produced by the RBF network.

To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose an angle-of-departure (AoD) adaptive subspace codebook for channel feedback in FDD massive MIMO systems. Our key insight is to leverage the observation that path AoDs vary more slowly than the path gains. Within the angle coherence time, by utilizing the constant AoD information, the proposed AoD-adaptive subspace codebook is able to quantize the channel vector in a more accurate way. From the performance analysis, we show that the feedback overhead of the proposed codebook only scales linearly with a small number of dominant (path) AoDs instead of the large number of BS antennas. Moreover, we compare the proposed quantized feedback technique using the AoD-adaptive subspace codebook with a comparable analog feedback method.

BoRF avoids the offline process of vocabulary construction, and does not suffer from the perceptual aliasing problem of BoW, thereby significantly improving the recall performance. To reduce the computational cost of direct feature matching, we exploit the fact that images in the case of robot navigation are acquired sequentially, and that feature matching repeatability with respect to scale can be learned and used to reduce the number of the features considered for matching.

Moreover, the proposed representation is symbolic employing key subsequences and potentially allows the application of text-based retrieval techniques into the similarity analysis of time series. The proposed method is fast and scales linearly with the size of database and the dimensionality. Contrary to the vast majority in the literature that uses the Euclidean distance, MVQ uses a multi-resolution/hierarchical distance function. We performed experiments with real and synthetic data.

However, working with floating point values significantly increases the HD computation cost. To address this issue, we proposed QuantHD, a novel framework for quantization of HD computing model during training. QuantHD enables HD computing to work with a low-cost quantized model (binary or ternary model) while providing a similar accuracy as the floating point model. We accordingly propose an FPGA implementation which accelerates HD computing in both training and inference phases. We evaluate QuantHD accuracy and efficiency on various real-world applications, and observe that QuantHD can achieve on average 17.2% accuracy improvement as compared to the existing binarized HD computing algorithms which provide a similar computation cost.

Prior work has leveraged the sparse nature of mmWave channels via compressed sensing-based algorithms for channel estimation. Most of these algorithms, though, assume perfect synchronization and are vulnerable to phase errors that arise due to carrier frequency offset and phase noise. Recently, sparsity-aware, non-coherent beamforming algorithms that are robust to phase errors were proposed for narrowband phased array systems with full resolution analog-to-digital converters. Such energy-based algorithms, however, are not robust to heavy quantization at the receiver. In this paper, we develop a joint carrier frequency offset and wideband channel estimation algorithm that is scalable across different hardware architectures. Our method exploits the sparse nature of mmWave channels in the angle-delay domain, in addition to the compressibility of the phase error vector. We formulate the joint estimation as a quantized sparse bilinear optimization problem and then use message passing for recovery. We also give an efficient implementation of a generalized bilinear message passing algorithm for the joint estimation in one-bit receivers. Simulation results show that our method is able to estimate the frequency offset and the channel compressibility, even in the presence of phase noise.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2019.2909865","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF-CNS-1702800,NSF-ECCS-1711702,NSF-CNS-1731658); Huawei Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692745","Wideband channel estimation;carrier frequency offset;compressed sensing;message passing;one-bit receivers;mm-Wave","Channel estimation;Phase noise;Receivers;Estimation;Frequency estimation;Wideband","analogue-digital conversion;array signal processing;channel estimation;compressed sensing;message passing;millimetre wave communication;optimisation","mmWave channels;phase error vector;joint estimation;quantized sparse bilinear optimization problem;generalized bilinear message passing algorithm;channel compressibility;phase noise;message passing-based joint CFO;mmWave systems;millimeter wave carrier frequencies;compressed sensing-based algorithms;narrowband phased array systems;energy-based algorithms;joint carrier frequency offset;full resolution analog-to-digital converters;wideband channel estimation algorithm;sparsity-aware noncoherent beamforming algorithms;angle-delay domain","","20","","44","IEEE","16 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is still the issue of efficiency when HEVC encryption is applied in the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT). Aiming at this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new low-overhead HEVC encryption scheme for energy-constrained IoMT. Concretely, the proposed scheme adjusts the selection of the aforementioned syntax elements to be encrypted according to the structure, texture, and motion energy present in each frame. It works as follows. The energy levels of quantized coefficients and motion vectors are calculated and compared with adaptive threshold values to classify the energy level in each video frame. When there is a high energy frame in the video, all the syntax elements are encrypted. When there is a low energy frame, alternate syntax elements are encrypted for achieving low encryption overhead. Moreover, in the case of transform coefficients, to withstand the interpolation attack, alternate coefficients are encrypted after correlating the frame with its neighboring coefficients. Extensive experiments were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently reduces the encryption overhead with low impact on the security level, making it suitable for IoMT.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2808174","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Discovery(grant numbers:Rgpin 04009); NBIF Start-Up(grant numbers:Rif 2017-012); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672411); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8295239","HEVC;Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT);multimedia security;low encryption overhead","Encryption;Streaming media;Transforms;Multimedia communication;Syntactics","cryptography;video coding","energy-aware encryption;securing Video transmission;High Efficiency Video Coding encryption;intra prediction modes;structural information;texture information;motion related codewords;motion information;considerable attention;low-overhead HEVC encryption scheme;energy-constrained IoMT;aforementioned syntax elements;motion energy present;energy level;quantized coefficients;motion vectors;video frame;high energy frame;low energy frame;alternate syntax elements;low encryption overhead;transform coefficients;alternate coefficients;neighboring coefficients;security level;multimedia things","","17","","32","IEEE","20 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the complexity of massive MIMO systems is tremendously increased when a large number of antennas and radio frequency chains (RF) are utilized. Therefore, a plethora of research efforts has been conducted to find the optimal precoding algorithm with lowest complexity. The main aim of this paper is to provide insights on such precoding algorithms to a generalist of wireless communications. The added value of this paper is that the classification of massive MIMO precoding algorithms is provided with easily distinguishable classes of precoding solutions. This paper covers linear precoding algorithms starting with precoders based on approximate matrix inversion methods such as the truncated polynomial expansion (TPE), the Neumann series approximation (NSA), the Newton iteration (NI), and the Chebyshev iteration (CI) algorithms. The paper also presents the fixed-point iteration-based linear precoding algorithms such as the Gauss-Seidel (GS) algorithm, the successive over relaxation (SOR) algorithm, the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm, and the Jacobi iteration (JI) algorithm. In addition, the paper reviews the direct matrix decomposition based linear precoding algorithms such as the QR decomposition and Cholesky decomposition (CD). The non-linear precoders are also presented which include the dirty-paper coding (DPC), Tomlinson-Harashima (TH), vector perturbation (VP), and lattice reduction aided (LR) algorithms. Due to the necessity to deal with a high consuming power by the base station (BS) with a large number of antennas in massive MIMO systems, a special subsection is included to describe the characteristics of the peak-to-average power ratio precoding (PAPR) algorithms such as the constant envelope (CE) algorithm, approximate message passing (AMP), and quantized precoding (QP) algorithms. This paper also reviews the machine learning role in precoding techniques. Although many precoding techniques are essentially proposed for a small-scale MIMO, they have been exploited in massive MIMO networks. Therefore, this paper presents the application of small-scale MIMO precoding techniques for massive MIMO. This paper demonstrates the precoding schemes in promising multiple antenna technologies such as the cell-free massive MIMO (CF-M-MIMO), beamspace massive MIMO, and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). In-depth discussion on the pros and cons, performance-complexity profile, and implementation solidity is provided. This paper also provides a discussion on the channel estimation and energy efficiency.

This paper is concerned with a class of DPLLs employing a binary-quantized phase detector, referred to as bang-bang PLLs (BBPLLs). They are widely used in clock and data recovery circuits and have recently been implemented as digital BBPLLs for high-bandwidth synthesis. Given that a DPLL implementation typically suffers from (excess) loop delay, this paper investigates the combined effect of loop delay and reference clock jitter in a first-order digital BBPLL. To statistically characterize the loop's timing jitter we formulate it as a discrete-time vector Markov process and numerically solve the associated Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. This allows us to compute the timing jitter probability density function in steady-state and to evaluate the jitter performance (timing offset and RMS timing jitter) for varying loop detuning, RMS reference clock jitter and loop delay.","2158-1525","978-1-4244-3827-3","10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5118282","","Delay effects;Clocks;Phase locked loops;Timing jitter;Charge pumps;Phase detection;Detectors;Circuit synthesis;Markov processes;Equations","charge pump circuits;delays;digital phase locked loops;Markov processes;phase detectors;timing jitter","loop delay;first-order digital bang-bang phase-locked loop;charge-pump-based analog PLL;binary-quantized phase detector;data recovery circuit;high-bandwidth synthesis;discrete-time vector Markov process;Chapman-Kolmogorov equation;timing jitter probability density function;RMS reference clock jitter","","4","","12","","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, theoretical analysis on the correlation is presented based on the multicolor light emitting diode (LED) and optical filter model. Experiments using LEDs of different wavelengths are conducted to observe the correlation of the channel matrix. Based on the experimental results, it is seen that the channel matrix is strongly correlated with a dominant eigenvalue as transmission distance and atmospheric condition change. Based on the low-rank feature of the channel matrix, we propose to project and quantize it in a low-dimensional space. Channel quantization design based on principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed such that the channel vector quantization can be transformed to scalar quantization.

Under this assumption, the recovery performance of the popular Generalized Lasso (G-Lasso) is by now well-established. In this paper, we extend these types of results to the practically relevant settings with quantized measurements. We study two extremes of the quantization schemes, namely, uniform and one-bit quantization; the former imposes no limit on the number of quantization bits, while the second only allows for one bit. In the presence of a uniform dithering signal and when measurement vectors are sub-gaussian, we show that the same algorithm (i.e., the G-Lasso) has favorable recovery guarantees for both uniform and one-bit quantization schemes. Our theoretical results, shed light on the appropriate choice of the range of values of the dithering signal and accurately capture the error dependence on the problem parameters. For example, our error analysis shows that the G-Lasso with one-bit uniformly dithered measurements leads to only a logarithmic rate loss compared to the full-precision measurements.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2020.2965733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8962284","Generalized Lasso;Gaussian width;dithered quantization;structured signal recovery","Quantization (signal);Noise measurement;Q measurement;Loss measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Current measurement;Geometry","error analysis;Gaussian processes;quantisation (signal)","one-bit uniformly dithered measurements;one-bit quantization schemes;measurement vectors;uniform dithering signal;quantization bits;quantized measurements;G-Lasso;generalized lasso;full-precision measurements;high-dimensional linear observations;structured signal recovery;dithered quantization;sub-Gaussian measurements","","3","","35","IEEE","17 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the bit-rate estimation method, a fast mode decision algorithm is presented, in which the estimated bit-rate values instead of the actual ones after entropy coding are adopted to calculate the Language cost in RDO mode decision and the entropy coding is performed only on the optimal mode.

Our goal is to characterize the optimal tradeoff between the average transmission power constraint, P and the average estimation distortion, D. It is well known that for point-to-point transmission of a single Gaussian source over an AWGN channel, if the channel bandwidth is equal to the source bandwidth, linear (scalar) joint source-channel coding, i.e., uncoded transmission, achieves the optimal power-distortion tradeoff (Shannonpsilas limit). But this result does not hold in the presence of fading. In this work, we show that a relatively simple joint source-channel coding scheme, proposed by Lapidoth et al., which is based on the transmission of scaled versions of vector-quantized source sequences, can approach the optimal power-distortion tradeoff. This coding scheme is still optimal when the CSI is available at both the encoder and the decoder.","","978-1-4244-1945-6","10.1109/BSC.2008.4563241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4563241","","Fading;Decoding;Bandwidth;AWGN channels;Channel coding;Communication systems;Java;Costs;Mathematics;Statistics","AWGN channels;combined source-channel coding;decoding;fading channels;linear codes","discrete memoryless Gaussian source transmission;memoryless fading channel;additive white Gaussian noise;AWGN channel;decoder;estimation distortion;point-to-point transmission;linear joint source-channel coding;vector-quantized source sequence","","1","","12","","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a higher need for low dosage in interventional applications as repeated scanning is performed. However, using the noisier and under-sampled low-dose datasets, the standard reconstruction algorithms produce low-resolution images with severe streaking artifacts. This adversely affects the CT assisted interventions. Recently, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have achieved state of-the-art results for the reconstruction of high fidelity images. The existing VAE approaches typically use mean squared error (MSE) as the loss, because it is convex and differentiable. However, pixel wise MSE does not capture the perceptual quality difference between the target and model predictions. In this work, we propose two simple but effective MSE based perception aware losses, which facilitate a better reconstruction quality. The proposed losses are motivated by perceptual fidelity measures used in image quality assessment. One of the losses involves calculation of the MSE in the spectral domain. The other involves calculation of the MSE in the pixel space and the Laplacian of Gaussian transformed domain. We use a hierarchical vector-quantized VAE equipped with the perception-aware losses for the artifact removal task. The best performing perception-aware loss improves the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) from 0.74 to 0.80. Further, we provide an analysis of the role of the pertinent components of the architecture in the denoising and artifact removal task.","","978-1-6654-0170-8","10.1109/ICHMS53169.2021.9582444","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582444","computed tomography;perception-aware;image reconstruction;deep learning;denoising;artifact removal","Computed tomography;Noise reduction;Computer architecture;Reconstruction algorithms;Predictive models;Loss measurement;Task analysis","computerised tomography;image denoising;image reconstruction;image resolution;mean square error methods;medical image processing;phantoms;tomography","existing VAE approaches;mean squared error;pixel wise MSE;perceptual quality difference;model predictions;simple but effective MSE;perception aware losses;reconstruction quality;perceptual fidelity measures;image quality assessment;hierarchical vector-quantized VAE;high fidelity images;state of-the-art results;VAEs;variational autoencoders;severe streaking artifacts;low-resolution images;standard reconstruction algorithms;low-dose datasets;repeated scanning;interventional applications;low dosage;low-dose strategies;computed tomography;radiation-related health risks;perception-aware losses facilitate CT denoising;performing perception-aware loss;artifact removal task","","1","","44","","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By interpreting the sparse prior from a Bayesian perspective, we can assume x follows certain sparse prior distribution and recover it using approximate message passing (AMP). However, the distribution parameters are unknown in practice and need to be estimated. Due to the increased computational complexity in the quantization noise model, previous works either use an approximated noise model or manually tune the noise distribution parameters. In this paper, we treat both signals and parameters as random variables and recover them jointly within the AMP framework. The proposed approach leads to a much simpler parameter estimation method, allowing us to work with the quantization noise model directly.

This paper presents a novel efficient method for recognizing isolated musical patterns, using discrete observation Hidden Markov Models. The first stage of our method is to extract a vector of frequencies from the musical pattern to be recognized. This is achieved by means of a combination of a moving window technique with a largest-Fourier-peak selection algorithm. Each extracted peak frequency is subsequently quantized to a symbol of a finite and discrete alphabet. The resulting sequence of quantized frequencies is given as input to a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Each HMM has been trained to model a specific pre-defined musical pattern. The unknown musical pattern is assigned to the model which generates the highest recognition probability. We have applied our method for the recognition of isolated musical patterns in the context of Greek Traditional Music. The resulting recognition rate was higher than 95%.

In this scheme, the DCT domain block is partitioned into vectors and then vector-quantized. The partition of the DCT block into vectors and the CVQ approach result in a much less complex coder than a conventional VQ in the spatial domain. A simple classification algorithm using two DCT coefficients and variance of the input DCT block as features for the classifier is proposed. Adaptive partitioning of the DCT block and bit assignment are found to be essential to achieve the overall goal. With the proposed DCT-CVQ visual quality comparable to that produced by existing coders is demonstrated for rates in the range of 0.45-0.65 bits/pixel.<>","1520-6149","","10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266808","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=266808","","Image coding;Discrete cosine transforms;Signal processing;Instruments;Rate distortion theory;Bit rate;Transform coding;Degradation;Computational complexity;Product codes","encoding;picture processing;transforms","adaptive partitioning;image coding;discrete cosine transform;classified vector quantizer;DCT domain block;CVQ;classification algorithm;bit assignment;visual quality","","12","5","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two analog feedback schemes are considered : the feedback of the channel vector and the feedback of the normalized channel vector. We provide bounds on the performance and give numerical results. We have shown that at low to medium uplink SNR the analog feedback of the normalized channel vector outperforms the analog feedback of the channel vector.

Due to the capacity constraints at the communication links, the data from the sensors are transmitted at a rate insufficient to convey all the observations reliably. Therefore, the observations are vector quantized and the estimation is done using the compressed measurements. In this paper, under the best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) fusion rule, we build the optimal sensor quantization scheme for state estimation in a static case, which uses only bivariate probability distributions of the state and sensor observations. For state estimation in a dynamic system, it is shown that, under the communication constraints, the state update reduces to quantizing and estimating the current state conditioned on all of the transmitted quantized measurements. To have a recursive form for state estimation update in a dynamic system, we assume the current quantized measurement is orthogonal to all past ones.

Therefore we refer to this representation as a layered representation. This representation induces an implicit correspondence relation between line segments associated with close views of the same object. An induced image-based representation of objects is a collection of image representations corresponding to their different views. Standard subspace-based methods are used to approximate this collection with the Karhunen-Loeve (principal components) technique.

First, the curse of dimensionality degrades the performance of many practical data processing techniques. Second, due to the existence of noise and outliers, feature extraction on corrupted data can not be effectively achieved. Recently, some representation based methods have produced promising results. However, these methods cannot handle the case in which nonlinear similarity exists and have failed to provide the quantized interpretability for the importance of features. In this paper, we propose a novel low rank and sparse representation method to realize dimensionality reduction and robustly extract latent low dimensional discriminative features. Specifically, we first adopt multiple kernel learning to map the original data into an embedded reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and then kernel based similarity discriminative projection is learned to explore the within-class and between-class variability. Notably, this low dimensional feature learning strategy is definitely integrated into the low rank matrix recovery of the kernel matrix. Next, we introduce the regularization of l2;1 norm on error matrix to eliminate noise and on projection matrix to lead the selected features to be more compact and interpretable. The non-convex optimization problem is effectively solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADM-M) methods. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2021.3087643","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876087); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9523854","Data representation;dimensionality reduction;feature selection;kernel;low-rank embedding;l2,1 norm","Kernel;Feature extraction;Dimensionality reduction;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Task analysis;Support vector machines","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Specifically, we conceive a complete procedure for acquiring the CSI that includes two key steps: channel estimation and channel quantization. The phase ambiguity (PA) is also quantized for coherent cooperative transmission. Based on the imperfect CSI, we aim to optimize the beamforming vectors in order to minimize the total transmit power subject to the users' rate requirements and fronthaul capacity constraints. We derive the closed-form expression of the achievable data rate by exploiting the statistical properties of multiple uncertain terms. Then, we propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm for solving this problem based on the successive convex approximation technique. In each iteration, the Lagrange dual-decomposition method is employed for obtaining the optimal beamforming vector. Furthermore, a pair of low-complexity user selection algorithms is provided to guarantee the feasibility of the problem.

The system model includes a base-station with M antennas and a large pool of users with a total feedback rate of B bits per fading block. The feedback process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the users measure their channel gains from each antenna and feedback the index of the antenna with the highest channel gain along with the gain itself. Based on this information, the base station schedules M users with the highest channel gains from its M antennas and polls those users for explicit quantization of their vector channels in the second stage. Based on these quantized channels, the base-station then forms zero-forcing beamforming vectors for downlink transmission. This paper presents an approximate analysis for the proposed scheme which is used to optimize the bit allocation between the two feedback stages. It is shown that for a total number of feedback bits B, the number of feedback bits assigned to the second stage, B2, should scale as M(M-1) log(SNR × B). In particular, the fraction B2/B behaves as logB/B in the asymptotic regime where B → ∞. Further, the approximate downlink sum rate is shown to scale as M log SNR + M log log B, suggesting that both multiuser multiplexing and multiuser diversity gains are realized. As the numerical results verify, the proposed feedback scheme, in spite of its low complexity, performs very close to the more complicated beamforming and scheduling schemes in the literature and in fact outperforms such schemes in the high-SNR regime.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-9268-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134081","","Array signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;Approximation methods;Bit rate;Interference;Downlink;Processor scheduling","antenna arrays;array signal processing;cellular radio;diversity reception;mobile antennas;multi-access systems;scheduling","limited feedback scheduling;beamforming scheme;multiuser multi-antenna systems;two-stage limited feedback beamforming;multiple antenna cellular communication systems;base station;channel gain;explicit quantization;vector channels;zero-forcing beamforming vectors;downlink transmission;bit allocation;downlink sum rate;multiuser multiplexing;multiuser diversity gains","","5","","12","","19 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We theoretically investigate the influence of DWs on the spin wave propagation and the corresponding magnonic band structure. It is found that the rotation of magnetization inside a DW introduces a geometric vector potential for the spin wave excitation. The corresponding Berry phase has quantized value 4nwπ, where nw is the winding number of the DW. Due to the topological vector potential, the magnonic band structure of MCs with DWs as comprising elements differs significantly from an identical MC composed of only magnetic domains.

In this overlay mode, since the signals transmitted to rural users should not interfere with mobile users of higher priority in the OFDMA-based cellular system, the beamforming vectors to rural users have to be orthogonal to the channel vectors of mobile users, which becomes a beamforming constraint for rural users. However, with limited feedback of channel state information (CSI) at a base station (BS), the orthogonal beamforming constraints may be not achieved. In such a practical case, conventional feedback schemes in which the channel direction information is uniformly quantized for a fixed codebook can be used. Unfortunately, it may not be efficient due to the orthogonality constraints. In this paper, we propose a new multiple beam selection (MBS) approach with limited feedback for rural users by taking into account the orthogonality constraints.

The energy spectrum is quantum (or digital) in other two cartesian directions where electron waves are standing waves. In the quantum limit, an electron (hole) occupies the lowest (highest) digitized/quantized state giving it a distinct 1D character. The energy E = vF | k | in carbon-based devices is linearly dependent on the wave vector k, where vF ≈ 106 m/s. This is in direct contrast to parabolic character E = ħ2 k2/2m* in solids with effective mass m*, for example in silicon NWs. The probability of changing wavevector from +ve to -ve direction through scattering or vice versa is greatly reduced and hence high mobility is expected, especially at low temperatures. The crucial outcome of this paper is the answer to the question: Does a higher mobility leads to a higher ultimate saturation velocity? The distribution function in a high electric field ε is then naturally asymmetrical affected by the energy ±qεℓ absorbed or emitted by a carrier of charge q during its ballistic flight in a mean free path ℓ. The ultimate drift in response to a high electric field results in unidirectional streaming of the otherwise randomly-oriented velocity vectors in equilibrium. The high-field drift limited by the intrinsic velocity is ballistic, unaffected by scattering-limited processes. The ultimate velocity is further limited to an emission of a quantum either in the form of an optical phonon or a photon by an electron excited to a higher state by the applied electric field. The velocity does not depend on scattering parameters. Ballistic processes as a result of reduction in length of a CNT or NW below the scattering-limited mean free path ℓ in the quasi-free direction are also discussed.","","978-1-4244-6609-2","10.1109/SMELEC.2010.5549503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5549503","","Ballistic transport;Nanowires;Carbon nanotubes;Optical scattering;Particle scattering;Electrons;Charge carriers;Carrier confinement;Magnetic confinement;Magnetic fields","ballistic transport;carbon nanotubes;electromagnetic wave scattering;nanowires;phonons;photons;probability;S-parameters","ballistic transport;nanowires;carbon nanotubes;charge carriers;quasi-free propagation;electron waves;analog energy spectrum;cartesian directions;standing waves;quantum limit;electron hole;carbon-based devices;wave vector;parabolic character;probability;ultimate saturation velocity;distribution function;high electric field;ballistic flight;unidirectional streaming;randomly-oriented velocity vectors;high-field drift;intrinsic velocity;scattering-limited processes;ultimate velocity;optical phonon;photon;scattering parameters","","","","22","","16 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The KLT has long been viewed as the best available block transform for a system that orthogonally transforms a vector source, scalar quantizes the components of the transformed vector using optimal bit allocation, and then inverse transforms the vector. This paper treats fixed-rate and variable-rate transform codes of non-Gaussian sources. The fixed-rate approach uses an optimal fixed-rate scalar quantizer to describe the transform coefficients; the variable-rate approach uses a uniform scalar quantizer followed by an optimal entropy code, and each quantized component is encoded separately. Earlier work shows that for the variable-rate case there exist sources on which the KLT is not unique and the optimal quantization and coding stage matched to a ""worst"" KLT yields performance as much as 1.5 dB worse than the optimal quantization and coding stage matched to a ""best"" KLT. In this paper, we strengthen that result to show that in both the fixed-rate and the variable-rate coding frameworks there exist sources for which the performance penalty for using a ""worst"" KLT can be made arbitrarily large. Further, we demonstrate in both frameworks that there exist sources for which even a best KLT gives suboptimal performance. Finally, we show that even for vector sources where the KLT yields independent coefficients, the KLT can be suboptimal for fixed-rate coding.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2004.831787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317109","","Transform coding;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Quantization;Source coding;Vectors;Decoding;Bit rate;Entropy;Pattern matching","Karhunen-Loeve transforms;variable rate codes;transform coding;entropy codes;source coding","suboptimality;Karhunen-Loeve transform;transform coding;block transform;bit allocation;inverse transforms;nonGaussian sources;fixed-rate transform codes;variable-rate transform codes;transform coefficients;optimal entropy code;source coding;quantisation","","49","1","19","IEEE","26 Jul 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many edge learning frameworks (e.g., federated learning) have been developed based on distributed gradient descent. Based on the approach, stochastic gradients are computed at edge devices and then transmitted to an edge server for aggregation for updating a global AI model. Since each gradient is typically high-dimensional (with millions to billions of coefficients), communication overhead may become a bottleneck for edge learning. In this work, we propose a novel gradient compression scheme to reduce the aforementioned overhead. Specifically, in the proposed scheme, the norm of the stochastic gradient is quantized using a uniform quantizer while the normalized stochastic gradient is decomposed into block gradients. A Grassmannian codebook is applied to quantizing each normalized block gradients. Their quantized versions are assembled using a so-called hinge vector, which is quantized using another Grassmannian codebook. Furthermore, a practical bit-allocation strategy is developed. By simulations, we show that similar learning performance can be achieved with substantially lower communication overhead as compared to the one-bit scalar quantization schemes used in the state-of-the-art design, namely signed SGD.","","978-1-7281-2723-1","10.1109/GlobalSIP45357.2019.8969082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8969082","","","approximation theory;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);quantisation (signal);stochastic processes","high-dimensional stochastic gradient quantization;communication-efficient edge learning;edge machine learning;network edge;distributed computation resources;federated learning;distributed gradient descent;edge devices;edge server;global AI model;aforementioned overhead;uniform quantizer;normalized stochastic gradient;Grassmannian codebook;normalized block gradients;quantized versions;similar learning performance;substantially lower communication overhead;one-bit scalar quantization schemes;massive mobile data;gradient compression scheme","","6","","16","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Being aware of interference data as a priori information, the BKIC aims at canceling the interference without estimating the interference channel. Since the target signals are represented by continuous real-valued variables, the previous BKIC scheme is constructed as a real-valued belief propagation (RBP) for implementing message passing on the factor graph that represents the corresponding signal model. To implement the RBP-BKIC, the real-valued variables are actually quantized into vectors of discrete values. As such, the quantized RBP-BKIC has some drawbacks: 1) its performance is determined by the quantization step size and 2) it can only be applied to real signaling with 1-D PAM modulations. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a GMMP scheme for the BKIC. First, we reveal that all messages passing over the factor graph of BKIC systems can be exactly represented by the mixtures of weighted Gaussian probability density functions. Superior to the quantized RBP-BKIC, we further show that the proposed GMMP scheme is an exact and efficient solution to the BKIC. In particular, it can approach performances of point-to-point communication systems with complex QAM modulations at the cost of affordable computational complexities. Moreover, we put forth a message passing framework that combines the GMMP-BKIC and the channel decoding into an iterative message passing scheme.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2019.2922392","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701311,61771315); Guangdong Education Project(grant numbers:2016KZDXM006); Shenzhen NSF Project(grant numbers:JCYJ20170818095107583,JCYJ20160226192223251,JCYJ20170412104656685,JCYJ20170302142312688); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745691","Known-interference cancellation;Gaussian mixture message passing;factor graph;belief propagation;joint interference cancellation and channel decoding","Message passing;Interference cancellation;Quantization (signal);Interference channels;Receivers;Wireless communication","decoding;Gaussian processes;interference suppression;iterative methods;message passing;mixture models;probability;pulse amplitude modulation;quadrature amplitude modulation;quantisation (signal)","discrete values;quantized RBP-BKIC;quantization step size;GMMP scheme;factor graph;BKIC systems;weighted Gaussian probability density functions;message passing framework;GMMP-BKIC;iterative message passing scheme;Gaussian mixture message passing scheme;blind known-interference cancellation;interference data;interference channel;target signals;real-valued variables;real-valued belief propagation;signal model;BKIC scheme;complex QAM modulations;1D PAM modulations","","1","","36","IEEE","25 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The bit-map generated by BTC is decomposed into a set of vectors which are vector quantized. Since the space of the BTC bit-map is much smaller than that of the original 8-b image, a lookup-table-based VQ encoder has been designed to 'fast encode' the bit-map. Adaptive DCT coding using residual error feedback is implemented to encode the high-mean and low-mean subimages. The overall computational complexity of BTC-VQ-DCT coding is much less than either DCT and VQ, while the fidelity performance is competitive.

In the scheme, a factor αm is defined to indicate the degree of FEXT coupling loss. Random codebook is utilized when αm is larger than the threshold which means FEXT is small. On the contrary, when the FEXT is serious and random codebook is not effective, the channel state information (CSI) which is quantized at receivers will be sent back to the transmitter. The amount of feedback is analyzed in the paper and it shows that the proposed method has reduced the overhead sharply compared to the current SNR-based method.

Cryptography is one of the most effective ways to enhance information security. Biometrics based cryptographic key generation techniques, in which biometric features are used to generate cryptographic keys, have been developed to overcome the shortages of the traditional cryptographic methods. An essential issue of biometric cryptographic key generation is to remove the variance between biometric templates of genuine users. In previous works, error correction techniques are used to eliminate these variances. However, these techniques can only be used to remove errors in Hamming metric whereas many biometric templates are real valued vectors and cannot use Hamming distance to measure the similarity, which means that the error correction techniques can not be directly used to remove the variance between these biometric templates. In this paper, we proposed a novel biometric cryptographic framework based on city block distance. In the proposed framework, the real valued biometric feature vector is firstly quantized and then encoded into a binary string in such way that the city block distance between two feature vectors is converted to Hamming distance between two binary strings. After that, the error correction techniques are used to eliminate the errors between the strings of the genuine users. Finally, the error free string is hashed to form a cryptographic key.

The problem is formulated as a general vector quantization problem with encoder side information, constrained quantization space and non-mean-square distortion function. By utilizing the high-resolution distortion analysis of the generalized quantizer, which is applicable to a wide range of scenarios, we obtain a tight lower bound on the capacity loss of the finite rate quantized MISO system over correlated fading channels. The lower bound of the capacity loss of correlated MISO channels is a generalization of existing results available for i.i.d. channels. The bound, in addition to providing insight into the exact nature of dependence of the quantization loss on the channel correlation matrix, indicates that the loss is less than that of the i.i.d. channels but with the same exponential decaying factor w.r.t. the feedback rate. The generality of the framework is further demonstrated by considering its application to the analysis of suboptimal mismatched channel quantizers, i.e. quantizers designed with an incorrect channel covariance matrix, and comparing it to systems with optimal quantizers.

When considering an OFB with an oversampling ratio of 3/2 and a transmission of quantized subbands on an AWGN channel, compared to a classical decoder, the performance gains are up to 9 dB in terms of SNR for the reconstructed signal, and 3 dB in terms of channel SNR.","2076-1465","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7074093","","Vectors;Signal to noise ratio;Quantization (signal);Indexes;Maximum likelihood estimation","AWGN channels;channel bank filters;maximum likelihood estimation;quantisation (signal);signal reconstruction;signal sampling","oversampled filter bank;noisy subbands;input signal reconstruction approach;OFB;noisy channel;maximum-likelihood estimation;quantization indexes;subband signals;quantization errors;AWGN channel;classical decoder;quantization noise","","","","19","","2 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a compression algorithm which involves a training process and employs a symbol encoding dictionary. During training, we derive specially structured tensors from a given image time sequence using the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. During runtime, every new image time sequence is quantized and encoded into a vector of coefficients corresponding to the learned CP decomposition. Experimental results on sequences of real satellite images demonstrate that we can efficiently handle higher-order tensors and obtain the decompressed data by composing the learned tensors by means of the received vector of coefficients, thus achieving a high compression ratio.","2076-1465","978-9-0827-9703-9","10.23919/EUSIPCO.2019.8902838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8902838","Compression;multispectral image time series;high-order tensors;CP decomposition;learning","Tensors;Image coding;Time series analysis;Training;Matrix decomposition;Compression algorithms;Dictionaries","data compression;decomposition;geophysical image processing;image coding;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);tensors;time series;vectors","earth observation;valuable spatial information;spectral information;temporal information;multidimensional arrays;training process;symbol encoding dictionary;learned CP decomposition;higher-order tensors;satellite image sequence;tensor decomposition learning;high-dimensional multispectral image time series compression algorithm;CANDECOMP-PARAFAC decomposition;CP decomposition;image time sequence quantisation;image encoding","","3","","23","","18 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach is based on the hierarchical clustering technique, derived from the statistical physics model of free energy (Jovovic 1996, Jovovic et al. 1999). The group vectors for image color are computed on the adaptively selected windows of computation, as contrasted to the block-size windows, optimizing the accuracy of the computation of the group vectors with the density of sampling an image by the group windows. The algorithm is suitable for implementation in parallel computer architectures. The results of quantization of color images by our algorithm are compared with 3 image compression techniques: 1) wavelets, 2) discrete cosine transform (DCT), and, 3) quad tree (QT). Contextual information of spatial coherency of the data is used in the segmentation process, in our algorithm. As a result, much better spatial resolution and small size of compressed images are obtained by our algorithm, as compared to the other techniques, for any error level of compression selected. Major spatial features are optimally color-coded along the hierarchy of scales of computation. The images quantized with our algorithm are suitable for the run-length encoding scheme of the hierarchy of binary images.","","0-7803-6725-1","10.1109/ICIP.2001.959195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959195","","Quantization;Multispectral imaging;Image coding;Discrete cosine transforms;Physics;Image sampling;Computer architecture;Color;Discrete wavelet transforms;Spatial coherence","image colour analysis;image coding;image segmentation;pattern clustering;image sampling;data compression;image resolution","multispectral images;multiscale space-color quantization;hierarchical clustering technique;free energy;group vectors;image color;adaptively selected windows;sampling;group windows;parallel architectures;image compression;contextual information;spatial coherency;segmentation process;spatial resolution;compressed images;error level;run-length encoding","","1","","7","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a recent study, Pudi et al. presented two efficient CS-based cryptosystems: CS using stream cipher (CSSC) and CSSC with encryption of MSB-bits (CSSC-EM). The proposed work aims to improve the energy efficiency of CSSC-EM further, without compromising security. While the random Bernoulli sensing matrix in CSSC-EM offers greater flexibility for embedding security, it suffers from a high computational cost. In contrast, the deterministic nature of the structurally random matrix (SRM) rectifies the computational burden, making the CS encoder energy-conserving. In this brief, we first quantify the security of CSSC and CSSC-EM against a chosen plaintext attack (CPA). Based on this cryptanalysis, we propose a CS-based energy efficient encryption scheme using an SRM for multimedia IoT. The artificial noise is injected to quantized CS measurements to resist CPA, based on the rate-distortion analysis of CS using SRM. Further, bitstream resulting from entropy coding of quantized CS measurements is randomly corrupted through an intentional error vector to achieve uniform probability distribution. We develop an efficient hardware implementation of the overall cryptosystem based on a linear feedback shift register.

Thus, complex multimodal inter-feature dependencies are not accurately modeled by Gaussian models, since they are unimodal distributions and mixtures of Gaussians are needed in these complex cases, but this is done in a loose and inefficient way. Graphical models provide a precise and simple mechanism to model the dependencies among two or more variables. This paper proposes the use of discrete random variables as observations and graphical models to extract the internal dependence structure in the feature vectors. Therefore, speech features are quantized to a small number of levels, in order to obtain a tractable model. These quantized speech features provide a mechanism to increase the robustness against noise uncertainty. In addition, discrete random variables allow the learning of joint statistics of the observation densities. A method to estimate a graphical model with a constrained number of dependencies is shown in this paper, being a special kind of Bayesian network. Experimental results show that by using this modeling, better performance can be obtained compared to standard baseline systems.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2092764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5638127","Bayesian networks;expectation–maximization;graphical models;maximum likelihood","Hidden Markov models;Graphical models;Bayesian methods;Approximation methods;Joints;Speech recognition;Covariance matrix","belief networks;Gaussian processes;hidden Markov models;speech recognition;statistical distributions","Bayesian network;discrete observation distribution;speech recognition;hidden Markov model state emission probability distribution;continuous random variable;Gaussian mixture;complex multimodal interfeature dependency;Gaussian model;unimodal distribution;graphical model;quantized speech feature;discrete random variable;standard baseline system","","5","","57","IEEE","15 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, we use two types of features: i) a quantized local spatial-temporal (ST) volumes (or cuboids), and ii) a quantized global features, which aims to capture the shape deformation of the actor by considering actions as 3D objects (x, y, t). For ST features, we extracted 100 interest cuboids from each video. Then, we used k-means algorithm to generate the code books with sizes 200 and 2,000. For global features, we uniformly sample interest points from each action volume. The k-means algorithm is applied again to quantize the feature vectors. Finally, all the classification experiments were carried out by using K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN) classifier. The performance of the proposed framework is tested on publicly available dataset.

Consequently, MO-MIMO enjoys much lower circuit power and cost in comparison with the conventional MIMO. Because the phase information is unavailable, all the existing MIMO baseband algorithms cannot be applied into MO-MIMO. Therefore, two types of channel estimators and multiuser detectors are constructed by first categorizing the channel estimation and multiuser detection problems as a quantized phase retrieval (PR) problem, and then solving the latter by developing two methods under the framework of generalized approximate message passing (GAMP). The first method directly applies GAMP to solve the quantized PR problem by exploiting the probability relationships between the quantized magnitude measurements and unknown complex signals. The second method iterates between the missing phase estimation and signal recovery, where the latter calls for GAMP to handle a linear mixing problem with quantized observations. The developed estimators and detectors call for matrix-vector multiplications and nonlinear function calculations as the most complex operations, handle the nonlinear quantization loss specially, and exploit the signal prior probability distributions.

To maximize the DL throughput, the cooperating base stations (BSs) jointly select the best set of users for DL scheduling and then jointly design a set of beamforming (BF) vectors to approach the throughput limit. However, finding the optimal BF vectors requires an exhaustive search and substantial channel state information (CSI) feedback, hence resulting in high algorithmic complexity and heavy uplink traffic load. Hence, we conceive a new cross-layer algorithm to achieve high performance at a lower feedback amount and at lower algorithmic complexity. Based on the fact that different BSs usually have different traffic loads, we divide the BSs into two different types, i.e., the master BSs (MBSs) and the slave BSs (SBSs), where MBSs have a higher transmission priority than SBSs. The scheduling relies on an interference threshold, whereas our robust BF scheme exploits both the channel direction information (CDI), which is quantized using the technique of limited feedback, and the channel quality information (CQI), which is assumed to be fed back accurately.

The quantization accuracy is formulated by the expectation of the inner product between the actual channel vector and the quantized channel vector. In order to maximize the quantization accuracy, we employ a new method which compensates the phase difference of the two channels.

In training low-precision networks, gradient descent in the backward pass is performed with high-precision weights while quantized low-precision weights and activations are used in the forward pass to calculate the loss function for training. Thus, the gradient descent becomes suboptimal, and accuracy loss follows. In order to reduce the mismatch in the forward and backward passes, we utilize mean squared quantization error (MSQE) regularization. In particular, we propose using a learnable regularization coefficient with the MSQE regularizer to reinforce the convergence of high-precision weights to their quantized values. We also investigate how partial L2 regularization can be employed for weight pruning in a similar manner. Finally, combining weight pruning, quantization, and entropy coding, we establish a low-precision DNN compression pipeline.

The proposed method treats each image set as a nonlinear face manifold that is composed of linear components. To find linear components of the face manifold, we first split image sets into subsets containing face images which share similar appearances. Then, our first proposed method approximates each subset by using the center of the deep feature representations of images in those subsets. Centers modeling the subsets are learned by using distance metric learning. The second proposed method uses discriminative common vectors to represent image features in the subsets, and entire subset is approximated with an affine hull in this approach. Discriminative common vectors are subset centers that are projected onto a new feature space where the combined within-class variances coming from all subsets are removed. Our proposed methods can also be considered as distance metric learning methods using triplet loss function where the learned subcluster centers are the selected anchors. This procedure yields to applying distance metric learning to quantized data and brings many advantages over using classical distance metric learning methods. We tested proposed methods on various face recognition problems using image sets and some visual object classification problems.

Each blocks descriptor is subsequently allocated to its corresponding cluster, whose centroid is updated using a weighted mean. The similarity measure is evaluated using a compact four dimensional feature vector from each cluster, which consists of the quantized centroid coordinates and the percentage contribution to the image composition by the cluster.

For downlink CoMP, most research work mainly focuses on precoding schemes with explicit feedback in joint processing/transmission (CoMP-JP) mode. However the explicit feedback type needs a high overhead under FDD mode. In this paper, we propose a signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) precoding scheme based on quantization-based combining (QBC) with limited feedback in downlink CoMP system. The QBC can convert the MIMO channel into a vector channel, and then the UE feeds back the index of its quantized channel according to the codebook, which further reduces the feedback resources.

Therefore, an effective VO tracking scheme would be essential to compensate this limitation.

The motion estimation and compensation, which is an essential part in the compression, is based on segment movements. The proposed codec sequentially employs the following steps. We first divide each frame in the sequence into blocks resulted from the block matching algorithm. Then we apply the Hough transform, in order to group it into segments. Each segment contains blocks that have similar motion parameters. We estimate the motion parameters for each segment using several motion models and least-squares algorithms and apply motion compensation upon the frames in each group. In the wavelet domain an optimal vector bit allocation is used to distribute the bit budget among consecutive frames. The manipulated frames in each group are quantized and coded using techniques from still image compression. The residual error of the compression is reduced by applying error correction in the wavelet domain to enhance the quality of the reconstructed sequence.","1520-6149","0-7803-7041-4","10.1109/ICASSP.2001.941240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=941240","","Video compression;Motion estimation;Wavelet domain;Image coding;Error correction;Codecs;Parameter estimation;Motion compensation;Bit rate;Image reconstruction","wavelet transforms;video coding;data compression;motion compensation;motion estimation;transform coding;Hough transforms;image segmentation;image matching;image sequences","wavelet video compression algorithms;region based motion estimation;region based motion compensation;segment movements;codec;video sequence;block matching algorithm;Hough transform;least-squares algorithm;motion compensation;wavelet domain;optimal vector bit allocation;manipulated frames;residual error;error correction;motion segmentation","","3","","11","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Apart from the music protocols, the synthesizer uses quantized variability for the fundamental frequency of the uttered phonemes in order to accurately depict intonation characteristics. The desired performance of the synthesizer is evaluated on the grounds of 'naturalness' and prosodic 'exactness'. The former has to do with the depth of analysis for the synthesized phonemes and the latter with the ability to describe intonation phenomena traced in the context of the supported languages. Thus far, the synthesizer can perform sufficiently in English (US) and Greek. In order to describe phenomena like petasi or vareia (accent of grave tone) that have been detected in Greek vocal forms, the synthesizer is equipped with a user interface that describes these phenomena, compiles and quantizes them in pitch-duration vectors and feeds in the synthesizer with the adequate information in order to produce as natural as possible utterances of synthetic speech.","","0-7803-6290-X","10.1109/MELCON.2000.880030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880030","","Speech synthesis;Psychoacoustic models;Instruments;Natural languages;Feeds;Signal synthesis;Timing;Protocols;Frequency synthesizers;User interfaces","speech synthesis;speech enhancement;electronic music;computer interfaces;object-oriented methods;music","prosodic enhancements;musical object oriented formant synthesizer;real time object oriented formant synthesizer;SKDNL specifications;MIDI specifications;music protocols;fundamental frequency;phonemes;intonation characteristics;performance evaluation;English;Greek;petasi;vareia;grave tone accent;user interface;pitch-duration vectors;synthetic speech","","1","","10","","2 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A criterion based on the average standard deviation of 8/spl times/8 subblocks is used to choose DWT or SVD. If the tile exhibits a high average standard deviation, it is compressed by using SVD otherwise by DWT. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are scalar and vector quantized respectively. The Daubechies 9/7 filter bank factored into lifting steps is used for the DWT. The maximum number of levels of subband decomposition for each tile is 3. Each subband is coded using the homogeneous connected-region interested ordered transmission (HC-RIOT). At the decoder side, the header of each compressed tile is read and the information is sent to the HC-RIOT decoder or to the inverse quantization, in order to recover the tile.

This result generalizes several previous data rate theorems that appeared in the literature, quantifying the amount of instability that can be tolerated when the estimated state is received by the controller over a noise-free digital channel. In the vector case, a necessary condition for stabilizability is derived and a corresponding control scheme is presented, which is tight in some special cases and which strictly improves on a previous result on stability over Markov erasure channels.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2012.2212616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263275","Communication theory;entropy;Markov channels;Markov jump linear systems;quantized control","Markov processes;Stability analysis;Decoding;Estimation error;Process control;Linear systems;Channel estimation","discrete time systems;feedback;information theory;matrix algebra;stability;stochastic systems;telecommunication channels","mean-square stabilization;discrete-time linear dynamical system;Markov time-varying digital feedback channel;Markov jump linear system;second moment matrix;data rate theorems;noise-free digital channel;stabilizability;Markov erasure channels","","74","","31","","8 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On one hand, the timing of event triggering carries implicit information about the state of the plant. On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel causes information loss, as it makes the state information available at the controller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition behavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given event-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing information carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can be stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical threshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization, and the required rate grows. When the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the plant, the implicit information carried by the triggering events perfectly compensates the loss of information due to the communication delay, and we recover the rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate theorem.

Due to this latter constraint, the design problem is an NP-hard quadratic program with discrete variables, and hence, is difficult to solve. In this paper, we tackle this difficulty by reformulating the problem in several steps into an equivalent continuous-domain biconvex form, including equivalent representations for discrete and binary constraints. Our final biconvex reformulation is obtained via an exact penalty approach and can efficiently be solved using a standard cyclic block coordinate descent algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed finite-alphabet precoding design for DACs with different resolutions, where it is shown that employing low-resolution DACs can lead to higher power efficiencies. In particular, we focus on a setup with one-bit DACs and show through simulation results that compared to the existing schemes, the proposed design can achieve SNR gains of up to 2 dB.

The probabilistic topic model (PTM) has been successfully applied to natural scenes by utilizing a single feature (e.g., the spectral feature); however, it is inadequate for HSR images due to the complex structure of the land-cover classes. Although several studies have investigated techniques that combine multiple features, the different features are usually quantized after simple concatenation (CAT-PTM). Unfortunately, due to the inadequate fusion capacity of k-means clustering, the words of the visual dictionary obtained by CAT-PTM are highly correlated. In this paper, a semantic allocation level (SAL) multifeature fusion strategy based on PTM, namely, SAL-PTM (SAL-pLSA and SAL-LDA) for HSR imagery is proposed. In SAL-PTM: 1) the complementary spectral, texture, and scale-invariant-featuretransform features are effectively combined; 2) the three features are extracted and quantized separately by k-means clustering, which can provide appropriate low-level feature descriptions for the semantic representations; and 3)the latent semantic allocations of the three features are captured separately by PTM, which follows the core idea of PTM-based scene classification. The probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models were compared to test the effect of different PTMs for HSR imagery. A U.S. Geological Survey data set and the UC Merced data set were utilized to evaluate SAL-PTM in comparison with the conventional methods. The experimental results confirmed that SAL-PTM is superior to the single-feature methods and CAT-PTM in the scene classification of HSR imagery.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2435801","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41371344); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2042014kf00231); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119589","Fusion;high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery;latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA);multifeature;probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA);probabilistic topic model (PTM);scene classification;Fusion;high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery;latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA);multifeature;probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA);probabilistic topic model (PTM);scene classification","Semantics;Visualization;Resource management;Probabilistic logic;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Probability","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;land cover;remote sensing","scene classification;multifeature fusion probabilistic topic model;high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery;HSR remote sensing image semantic interpretation;probabilistic topic model;HSR images;land-cover classes;inadequate fusion capacity;k-means clustering;visual dictionary;semantic allocation level;SAL multifeature fusion strategy;captured scale-invariant-feature-transform features;PTM-based scene classification;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;latent Dirichlet allocation models;US Geological Survey data set;single-feature methods;HSR imagery scene classification","","182","","57","IEEE","8 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sensor measurements are simply binary quantized and transmitted to a remote fusion center over noisy flat fading wireless channels under an average sum transmit power constraint. The objective is to determine a set of optimal quantization thresholds and sensor transmit powers, called an optimal policy, which minimizes the long run average of a weighted combination of the expected state estimation error and sum transmit power. We analyze the problem by formulating an adaptive Markov decision process (MDP) problem. In this framework, adaptive optimal control policies are obtained using a nonstationary value iteration (NVI) scheme and are termed as NVI-adaptive policies. These NVI-adaptive policies are adapted to the HMM parameter estimates obtained via a strongly consistent maximum likelihood estimator. In particular, HMM parameter estimation is performed by a recursive expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which computes estimates of the HMM parameters by maximizing a relative entropy information measure using the received quantized observations and the trajectory of the MDP. Under some regularity assumptions on the observation probability distributions and a geometric ergodicity condition on an extended Markov chain, the maximum-likelihood estimator is shown to be strongly consistent. It is shown that the NVI-adaptive policy based on this sequence of strongly consistent HMM parameter estimates is (asymptotically, under appropriate assumptions) average-optimal. Essentially, it minimizes the long run average cost of the weighted combination of the expected state estimation error and sum transmit power across the sensors for the HMM with true parameters in a time-asymptotic sense. The advantage of this scheme is that the policies are obtained recursively without the need to solve the Bellman equation at each time step, which can be computationally prohibitive. As is usual with value iteration schemes, practical implementation of the NVI-adaptive policy requires discretization of the state and action space, which results in some loss of optimality. Nevertheless, numerical results illustrate the asymptotic convergence properties of the parameter estimates and the asymptotically close to optimal performance of the adaptive MDP algorithm compared to the performance of an MDP based dynamic quantization and power allocation algorithm designed with perfect knowledge of the true parameters.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2011.2179420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6099562","Hidden Markov models (HMMs);maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation;quantization;state estimation;wireless sensor networks","Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Vectors;State estimation;Parameter estimation;Quantization","fading channels;hidden Markov models;iterative methods;maximum likelihood estimation;parameter estimation;quantisation (signal);sensor fusion;state estimation;wireless sensor networks","dynamic quantization;power allocation;multisensor estimation;hidden Markov model;optimal quantizer design problem;sensor measurement;remote fusion center;noisy flat fading wireless channels;average sum transmit power constraint;optimal quantization threshold;optimal policy;state estimation error;adaptive Markov decision process;adaptive optimal control policy;nonstationary value iteration scheme;NVI-adaptive policy;HMM parameter;strongly consistent maximum likelihood estimator;parameter estimation;recursive expectation-maximization algorithm;observation probability distributions;geometric ergodicity condition;extended Markov chain;Bellman equation;power allocation algorithm;wireless sensor network","","5","","50","IEEE","9 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The cell writing - or programming - process applies specified voltages in a sequential manner, injecting charge to achieve a desired level. Reducing a cell level requires a costly block erasure, so programming only increases cell levels. Parallel programming, whereby a common voltage is applied to a group of cells to inject charge simultaneously, simplifies circuitry and increases programming speed. However, cell-to-cell variations and limited programming round can adversely affect its precision. In this paper, we consider algorithms for efficient cell programming. Since cell levels are quantized to a discrete set of values, our objective is to minimize the number of cells that are not quantized to their target levels. For a specified number of programming rounds, we derive an optimal parallel programming algorithm with complexity that is polynomial in the number of cells. We extend the algorithm to account for intercell interference, where the voltage applied to a cell can affect the level of adjacent cells. We then consider noisy programming of a single cell, with and without feedback about the cell level. In both scenarios, we present an algorithm that, for a given number of programming rounds, minimizes the probability of an incorrect cell level.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2013.2292819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675761","Parallel programming;flash memory programming;intercell interference","Ash;Parallel programming;Cost function;Vectors;Noise;Educational institutions","data structures;flash memories;parallel programming;polynomials","noisy programming;adjacent cells;polynomial;optimal parallel programming algorithm;programming rounds;block erasure;data representation;multilevel flash memory;optimized cell programming","","4","","17","IEEE","26 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these techniques require an accurate knowledge of the channel of the different users at the transmitter. In frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems, this information has to be provided by the different users, motivating the research of efficient limited feedback schemes. This paper presents a novel statistical characterization of the spatial multiple-input-single-output (MISO) channel. In this characterization, one antenna is selected as the reference, and the channel fading experienced from this antenna is also considered to be the reference. The conditional probability density functions (CPDFs) of the envelope and phase of the channel fading coefficients from the rest of the antennas (denoted as nonreference channel fading and nonreference antennas) are obtained given the reference one. Based on this statistical characterization, this paper proposes a channel quantization scheme that individually quantizes the channel fading coefficient of each transmit antenna that is seen by each user. The envelope and phase of the reference channel fading are quantized considering a Rayleigh distribution and a uniform distribution, respectively. The nonreference channel fading coefficients are quantized according to their respective CPDFs, which in turn depend on the spatial correlation between each channel fading and the reference channel fading. Numerical simulations have been carried out to compare the performance of the proposed conditional quantization (CQ) scheme with a polar quantization (PQ) and with a quantization based on the Karhunen-Loève (KL) transform. PQ does not consider spatial correlation, CQ needs one spatial correlation coefficient per nonreference antenna, and the KL scheme makes use of the full spatial correlation matrix. The results show that CQ achieves a lower quantization mean square error (MSE) than the other two schemes in highly and moderately correlated environments. When the spatial channel model (SCM) is considered, the proposed scheme allows the spatial correlation to be successfully exploited in arrays with N = 4 and N = 8 transmit antennas for antenna separations that are lower than d= 1.3λ and d=0.75λ, respectively.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2363170","European Union ERDF and Spanish Government through Project TEC2012-38142-C04; Generalitat Valenciana through Project PROMETEOII/2014/003; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924760","Channel quantization;limited feedback;multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems;spatial correlation;wireless communications","Quantization (signal);Correlation;Transmitting antennas;Rayleigh channels;Vectors","frequency division multiplexing;mean square error methods;MIMO communication;numerical analysis;probability;quantisation (signal);radio transmitters;Rayleigh channels;transmitting antennas","spatially correlated fading;channel quantization;statistical characterization;multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output techniques;MU-MIMO techniques;wireless communication systems;radio transmitter;frequency division duplex systems;spatial multiple-input-single-output channel;conditional probability density functions;channel fading coefficients;nonreference channel fading;nonreference antennas;transmit antenna;Rayleigh distribution;uniform distribution;numerical simulations;polar quantization;Karhunen-Loeve transform;spatial correlation matrix;mean square error","","2","","32","IEEE","15 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SUs sense the spectrum by measuring the energy statistics of the received signals. The measured energy statistics are quantized with a Lloyd-Max quantizer at the SUs and forwarded to the FC, which then performs soft combining over the quantized information. This is different from most previous works that forward hard decisions based on local sensing results at the SUs. Due to the wireless nature of the channel, signals transmitted by one SU to the FC will also be observed by the other SU, which can cooperate with the transmitting SU by relaying the observed signals to the FC. In recognition of the strong correlation between the signals observed at the FC and the relay SU, a new asymmetric Slepian-Wolf code is employed at the relay SU to reduce the amount of cooperation information, thus to improve the cooperation efficiency. In addition, we propose to unequally allocate energy among the coded bits to compensate the energy loss due to the redundancy introduced by the coded cooperation, and this yields better performance compared to conventional equal energy coding schemes.

To obtain a high coding accuracy, the analysis-by-synthesis error measure used during coding process is also used in the codebook design procedure. Due to the simultaneous occurance of quantized amplitude vector and quantized gain in the error measure, both codebooks are optimized iteratively.

Due to its efficiency, beamforming with limited feedback has been adopted in several wireless communication standards. Prior work on limited feedback commonly adopts the block fading channel model where temporal correlation in wireless channels is neglected. In this paper, we consider temporally correlated channels and design single-user transmit beamforming with limited feedback. Analytical results concerning CSI feedback are derived by modeling quantized CSI as a first-order finite-state Markov chain. These results include the information rate of the CSI quantizer output, the bit rate a CSI feedback channel is required to support, and the effect of feedback delay on throughput. In particular, based on the theory of Markov chain convergence rate, feedback delay is proved to reduce the throughput gain due to CSI feedback at least exponentially. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for CSI feedback compression in time. Combining the results in this work leads to a new method for designing limited feedback beamforming as demonstrated by a design example.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2014272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770163","Array signal processing;Doppler effect;feedback communication;Markov processes;time-varying channels;vector quantization","Array signal processing;State feedback;MIMO;Output feedback;Throughput;Channel state information;Wireless communication;Communication standards;Fading;Information rates","array signal processing;channel estimation;correlation methods;delays;fading channels;feedback;Markov processes;MIMO communication;quantisation (signal)","temporally-correlated channels;limited feedback beamforming;channel state information;quantization;multiple-input-multiple-output wireless systems;wireless communication standard;block fading channel model;single-user transmit beamforming;CSI feedback;finite-state Markov chain;feedback delay","","92","3","66","IEEE","2 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) characteristic of this model is analyzed, which helps derive an upper bound of average throughput loss relative to perfect IA. The upper bound is shown to be tight by simulation, particularly in the high-feedback regime. Based on this result, the scaling laws of feedback bits for channels, precoding, and decoding vectors to obtain full degree of freedom are derived, which are backward compatible to the existing results for quantized CSI only or quantized precoder only.

This scheme is shown to be able to solve to a good degree many problems related to DSR.

We propose a PA scheme that uses a codebook of quantized PA vectors designed offline and known to the source, relay, and destination. The destination, which has full knowledge of channel side information (CSI), chooses one of the codebook vectors and conveys back to the source and relay. With the limited amount of available feedback, the design of an appropriate codebook is central to PA, which varies depending on the destination's strategy to choose the optimal PA vector. Assuming high received SNR on either link in the relay path, we first derive the optimal PA solutions as the function of channel realizations with two design criteria, maximizing capacity and minimizing error rate. It is found that when there is high received SNR in either the relay path or the direct path, the optimal solutions for both criteria reduce to simple forms. For maximizing capacity, the available power should be equally allocated to each OFDM subcarrier shared by the source and relay; while for minimum error rate, the available power should be allocated such that the received SNRs for all subcarriers at the destination are the same. The findings lead us to the sub-optimal solutions with great complexity reduction. We then present an adaptation of Lloyd's algorithm to construct a codebook to quantize the optimal PA vectors subject to the amount of feedback. Simulations show that a mild to negligible performance loss can be achieved with only a few bits of feedback at different SNR values.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199558","","Feedback;Power system relaying;OFDM;Relays;Peer to peer computing;Design engineering;Power engineering and energy;MIMO;Array signal processing;Error analysis","modulation coding;OFDM modulation;radio links;resource allocation","power allocation design;two-hop relay;channel side information;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;codebook vectors;complexity reduction;Lloyd algorithm","","19","","16","","11 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, one serious drawback of sparse space based methods is that similar local features can be quantized into different visual words.

One reason for this can be attributed to the popular codebook-based image representation, often resulting in loss of subtle image information that are critical for fine-grained classification. Another way to address this problem is to introduce human annotations of object attributes or key points, a tedious process that is also difficult to generalize to new tasks. In this work, we propose a codebook-free and annotation-free approach for fine-grained image categorization. Instead of using vector-quantized codewords, we obtain an image representation by running a high throughput template matching process using a large number of randomly generated image templates.

Because of hardware constraints, the former approach is often elected. However, when the weight accumulator input is quantized, care must be exercised to prevent the algorithm from stalling. To overcome this difficulty, a sequence of random vectors, called ""dither,"" is used to ""linearize"" the gradient quantizer.

In this paper, we discover that different coding schemes usually produce substantially inconsistent coefficients, each preferring either ℓ1-sparsity or bases-locality. We therefore conjecture that different schemes should be explored simultaneously to further enhance the quantization quality. To this end, we propose a novel ensemble framework, Local Hybrid Coding (LHC), to formalize a unified optimization problem for different coding schemes. Specifically, we quantize each image descriptor using two disjoint sets of dictionaries, fcNN bases and non-fcNN bases, from which we efficiently compute a hybrid representation comprising of local coding and sparse coding, respectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks verify that LHC can remarkably outperform several state-of-the-art methods for image classification tasks, and bare comparable complexity to the most efficient coding methods.","1051-4651","978-1-4799-5209-0","10.1109/ICPR.2014.643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977355","","Encoding;Large Hadron Collider;Dictionaries;Image coding;Accuracy;Vectors;Training","encoding;image classification;image representation","local hybrid coding;sparse coding;SPM-based image classification algorithms;low-level image descriptor;over-complete dictionary;ℓ1-sparsity penalty;fc-nearest-neighbor bases;LHC;unified optimization problem;image descriptor;fcNN bases;non fcNN bases;hybrid representation","","5","","23","","6 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper compares and contrasts this classical result with several recently explored alternative schemes for encoding source samples taken at a high rate. The first scheme, which scalar quantizes the samples and then losslessly encodes the quantized samples at their entropy-rate, is known to have rate approaching infinity when distortion is held at D. Is such catastrophic behavior due to the scalar quantizer or to the distributed nature of the quantization? Recent results show that even without a transform, but with distributed vector quantization, it is possible to attain performance that differs from the rate-distortion function by only a finite constant. This suggests it was the scalar quantizer that caused the catastrophic behavior. The final recent result suggests the situation is more nuanced, because it shows that if in the classical scheme scalar quantizers with entropy coding replace the ideal coding of the coefficients at their first-order rate-distortion functions, then again performance differs from the rate-distortion function by a finite constant.","","978-0-615-15314-8","10.1109/ITA.2007.4357596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357596","","Source coding;Encoding;Rate-distortion;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Sampling methods;H infinity control;Block codes;Discrete transforms;Vector quantization;Entropy coding","Karhunen-Loeve transforms;source coding","centralized lossy source coding;distributed lossy source coding;densely sampled Gaussian data;rate distortion function;Karhunen Loeve transform;coding transform coefficients;scalar quantizer","","1","","13","","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee a concise high-resolution distortion analysis in the complex domain is presented. Second, as an application of the proposed complex distortion analysis, tight lower bounds on the capacity loss due to the finite-rate channel quantization are provided for MIMO systems employing a fixed number of equal power spatial beams. Based on the obtained closed-form analytical results, it is shown that the system capacity loss decreases exponentially as the ratio of the quantization rate to the total degrees of freedom of the channel state information to be quantized. Moreover, MIMO CSI-quantizers using mismatched codebooks that are only optimized for high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low-SNR regimes are also investigated to quantify the penalties incurred by the use of mismatched codebooks. In addition, the analysis is extended to deal with MIMO systems using multi-mode spatial multiplexing transmission schemes with finite-rate CSI feedback.

Popular video manipulation functions include overlap (opaque or semitransparent), translation, scaling, linear filtering, rotation, and pixel multiplication. We propose algorithms to manipulate compressed video in the compressed domain. Specifically, we focus on compression algorithms using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) with or without motion compensation (MC). Such compression systems include JPEG, motion JPEG, MPEG, and H.261. We derive a complete set of algorithms for all aforementioned manipulation functions in the transform domain, in which video signals are represented by quantized transform coefficients. Due to a much lower data rate and the elimination of decompression/compression conversion, the transform-domain approach has great potential in reducing the computational complexity. The actual computational speedup depends on the specific manipulation functions and the compression characteristics of the input video, such as the compression rate and the nonzero motion vector percentage. The proposed techniques can be applied to general orthogonal transforms, such as the discrete trigonometric transform. For compression systems incorporating MC (such as MPEG), we propose a new decoding algorithm to reconstruct the video in the transform domain and then perform the desired manipulations in the transform domain. The same technique can be applied to efficient video transcoding (e.g., from MPEG to JPEG) with minimal decoding.<>","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.363151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=363151","","Video compression;Transform coding;Discrete transforms;Discrete cosine transforms;Decoding;Maximum likelihood detection;Compression algorithms;Motion compensation;Computational complexity;Transcoding","video coding;motion compensation;decoding;video signal processing;image coding;data compression;discrete cosine transforms","MC-DCT compressed video;compression algorithms;compositing;orthogonal transforms;decoding algorithm;video manipulation;video transcoding;translation;scaling;linear filtering;rotation;pixel multiplication;discrete cosine transform;DCT;motion compensation;JPEG;motion JPEG;MPEG;H.261;transform domain;quantized transform coefficients;computational complexity","","223","127","38","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since it uses fabrication processes with large feature sizes, the defect density for RSFQ is dramatically lower than its CMOS counterpart. Hence, process variations and other RSFQ-specific non-idealities become the major causes of chip failures. Because of the nature of its quantized pulse-based operation, even highly-distorted pulses are interpreted logically correctly by cells, but the timings is affected. Therefore, timing verification and delay testing increase in importance in RSFQ. In this paper, we address several radically new phenomena in RSFQ technology, especially the existence of single-pattern delay tests and the need to propagate delayed values via multiple pipeline stages. We then characterize cells under process variations and identify delay excitation conditions, sensitization conditions, and conditions for propagation of the logic errors caused by process variations. We then propose a completely new ATPG paradigm which utilizes these new phenomena to select target delay subpaths and generate test patterns that are guaranteed to excite the worst-case delay along each target delay sub-path.

In this paper, we propose a reduced complexity precoding method based on linear programming and constructive interference that exploits an initial approximate solution to significantly reduce the dimension of the search. In particular, the method uses the output of an initial quantized linear precoder and updates only those elements that do not satisfy a certain reliability condition.

The proposed equalizer is based on the forward-backward algorithm. In contrast to conventional approaches, state reliability information is exchanged with a finite alphabet message instead of a real-valued probability vector. Moreover, each node update performs only a single lookup instead of many arithmetic operations. The lookup table construction aims at maximizing the preserved relevant mutual information. We propose a symmetric KL-means IB algorithm applied in an iterative discrete density evolution procedure. Based on the resulting distributions, a new static design technique creates three reusable symmetric lookup tables to perform forward, backward and final node updates. This way, coarse quantization is an integral part of the system design in the first place rather than a separate follow-up process. Two different ISI channel setups show that the proposed equalizers can achieve comparable performance to the high-resolution alternatives. Remarkably, the state metrics require an order of magnitude fewer bits, which potentially improves area and energy efficiency. Also, a lookup table sharing approach is presented to spread the implementation cost across sub-block equalizers operating in parallel.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8347-7","10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9839143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9839143","","Measurement;Quantization (signal);Equalizers;Modulation;Receivers;Iterative algorithms;Reliability","energy conservation;equalisers;evolutionary computation;intersymbol interference;iterative methods;low-power electronics;quantisation (signal);receivers;table lookup","information bottleneck receivers;ISI channels;coarsely quantized messages;forward-backward algorithm;state reliability information;finite alphabet message;node update;single lookup;lookup table construction;symmetric KL-means IB algorithm;iterative discrete density evolution procedure;static design technique;reusable symmetric lookup tables;coarse quantization;subblock equalizers;relevant mutual information;energy efficiency;area efficiency","","","","19","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our motivation stems from the complexity of multiuser scheduling. For instance, MU-MIMO scheduling involves the selection of a user subset and associated rate selection each time-slot for varying channel states (the vector of quantized channels matrices for each of the users) — a complex integer optimization problem that is different for each channel state. Instead, our algorithm clusters the collection of channel states to a much lower dimension, and for each cluster provides achievable multiuser capacity trade-offs, which can be used for user and rate selection. Our algorithm uses a bandit approach, where it learns both the unknown partitions of the channel-state space (channel-state clustering) as well as the rate region for each cluster along a pre-specified set of directions, by observing the success/failure of the scheduling decisions (e.g. through packet loss). We propose an epoch-greedy learning algorithm that achieves a sub-linear regret, given access to a class of classifying functions over the channel-state space. We empirically validate our approach on a high-fidelity 5G New Radio (NR) wireless simulator developed within AT&T Labs. We show that our epoch-greedy bandit algorithm learns the channel-state clusters and the associated rate regions. Further, adaptive scheduling using this learned rate-region model (map from channel-state to the set of feasible rates) outperforms the corresponding hand-tuned static maps in multiple settings. Thus, we believe that auto-tuning cellular systems through learning-assisted scheduling algorithms can significantly improve performance in real deployments.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2021.3077455","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1731658,CNS-1718089,CNS-1910112); Army Futures Command(grant numbers:W911NF-19-2-0333); Wireless Networking and Communications Group Industrial Affiliates Program; Data-Supported Transportation Operations and Planning (D-STOP) Tier 1 University Transportation Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9435952","Online learning;bandit algorithms;wireless networks;scheduling;capacity region;auto-tuning","Clustering algorithms;Wireless communication;Optimization;Schedules;Transportation;Physical layer;Mathematical model","5G mobile communication;adaptive scheduling;cellular radio;greedy algorithms;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;multiuser channels;pattern clustering;telecommunication computing;telecommunication scheduling;wireless channels","learned rate-region model;learning-assisted scheduling algorithms;low-dimensional clustering;multiuser scheduling;associated rate selection;channel-state space;channel-state clustering;epoch-greedy learning algorithm;epoch-greedy bandit algorithm;channel-state clusters;quantized channel matrices;multiuser rates;cellular scheduling;auto-tuning;MU-MIMO scheduling;complex integer optimization problem;sublinear regret;high-fidelity 5G new radio wireless simulator;adaptive scheduling;hand-tuned static maps;auto-tuning cellular systems","","","","19","IEEE","19 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The features used for recognition purpose are mainly based on directional information obtained from the arc tangent of the gradient. To get the feature, at first, a 2 times 2 mean filtering is applied 4 times on the gray level image and a non-linear size normalization is done on the image. A Roberts filter is then applied on the normalized image to obtain gradient image. Next, the arc tangent of the gradient (direction of gradient) is initially quantized into 32 directions and the strength of the gradient is accumulated with each of the quantized direction. Finally, the frequencies of these directions are down sampled using Gaussian filter to get 392 dimensional feature vectors.

For SKG, a pair (or more) of highly correlated secret vectors (SVs) need to be respectively quantized into a pair (or more) of almost identical sequences of binary bits (i.e., keys). The literatures on SKG in the wireless community almost uniformly default on a direct quantization on SVs. On the other hand, many works on biometric template security advocate a quantization on the output of a one-way function of SVs. In this paper, we present a generalized approach for SKG called continuous encryption before quantization (CEbQ). By CEbQ, a pair of SVs of limited dimension are first transformed by a continuous encryption function into a pair of sequences of quasi-continuous pseudorandom numbers (QCPRNs) of any desired length, and then these QCPRNs are quantized into keys. We show that CEbQ can yield a much lower key error rate than direct quantization subject to standardized randomness tests.

The differential group delays of these modes cause modal dispersion, thus limiting the data rate. Recent results, however, have shown the existence of a set of principal modes (PMs) that allow dispersion free communication, to the first order. Moreover, the orthogonal nature of these PMs allows for convenient multiplexing in MMFs with low mode-dependent losses. To effectively utilize these PMs at the transmitter, it is essential to estimate them and feed them back to the transmitter. In this paper, we propose two quantization schemes that enable efficient encapsulation of the PMs for feedback. For shorter length MMF links, we generate a vector quantization codebook based on the Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm, while for long links with strong mode coupling, we show analytically that the PMs are Haar distributed, and use a Grassmannian line packing based quantization codebook. Simulations reveal that the quantization effectively limits dispersion and the performance of the quantized PMs is within 2 dB of the ideal principal modes with only 6 bits used for quantization. In addition, the quantized PMs allow for efficient multiplexing with just 3% cross-talk.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-6664-6","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510928","","Couplings;Quantization (signal);Multiplexing;Optical transmitters;Dispersion;Delays;Receivers","feedback;Haar transforms;optical fibre communication;quantisation (signal)","Grassmannian line packing;Haar distributed;Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm;vector quantization codebook;quantization schemes;dispersion free communication;differential group delays;MMF links;high speed multimode fiber links;principal modes;feedback quantization","","","","17","","14 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A similarity matrix giving distances between the frames is generated for use by dynamic time warping. Preliminary experiments were conducted to find optimum parameter values by evaluating motion retrieval performance. One important feature of the proposed method is that, if the bit length for the frame representation is fixed, the distance between any two frames in any two motions can be found as an element of the similarity matrix without changing its size, which can achieve rapid motion retrieval via dynamic time warping. Experimental comparison with existing methods demonstrated that our proposed technique can complete retrieval tasks over six times faster than a traditional dynamic time warping method, while achieving almost the same levels of accuracy and computation cost as those for the k-d tree method described in [1].

Based on those quantized vectors, the transmitter applies either constant, linear, or higher-order interpolation with the remaining beamforming vectors. With constant interpolation, we derive the approximate sum achievable rate and the optimal cluster size that maximizes the approximate rate. For linear interpolation, we derive a closed-form expression for the phase rotation by utilizing the correlation between OFDM subcarriers. We also propose a higher-order interpolation that requires more than two quantized vectors to interpolate transmit beamformers, and is based on existing channel estimation methods. Numerical results show that interpolation with the optimized cluster size can perform significantly better than that with an arbitrary cluster size. For the second proposed method, a channel impulse response is quantized with a uniform scalar quantizer. With channel quantization, we also derive the approximate sum achievable rate.

Some of these applications are likely to get great benefit from watermarking technology, since it can enable a number of innovative services, such as conditional access policies, data annotation, data labeling, content authentication, to be implemented at a low price. One of the key points of the MPEG-4 standard is the possibility to access and manipulate objects within a video sequence. Thus object watermarking has to be achieved in such a way that, while a video object is transferred from a sequence to another, it is still possible to correctly access the data embedded within the object itself. The algorithm proposed in this paper embeds a watermark in each video object by imposing a particular relationship between some predefined pairs of quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in the luminance blocks of pseudo-randomly selected macroblocks (MBs). Watermarks are equally embedded into intra and inter MBs.

Applying the criterion to local windows in the class-map results in the ""J-image"", in which high and low values correspond to possible region boundaries and region centers, respectively.

The use of polynomials allows compensating every possible input rotor position without carrying out an interpolation or a rounding to the nearest quantized value. The PA algorithm has been implemented to work in real time on a TM4 EV drive controlling an 80 kW PMSM. The performance of the algorithm has been validated at 6000 and 9000 r/min under +85 and ±55 Nm of torque, respectively. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) effects have been minimized using a type-2 phase-locked loop (PLL). The proposed PA algorithm assisted with the PLL is capable of reducing the total position error to a range as small as ±0.2°. The combination of these two algorithms is a promising solution for compensating the position error in quadrature analog encoders.

The temporal causality of the features is then captured by hidden Markov models dedicated to trajectory description, whose states are properly quantized values. The similarity between trajectories is expressed by exploiting this quantization-based HMM framework. Moreover statistical techniques have been developed for parameter estimations.

However, the high-resolution color histograms are usually of high dimension and contain much redundant information which does not relate to the image content, while the low-resolution histograms cannot provide adequate discriminative information for image classification. In this paper, a new color feature representation is proposed which not only takes the correlation among neighbouring components of the conventional color histogram into account but removes the redundant information as well. A high-resolution, uniform quantized color histogram is first obtained from the image. Then the redundant bins are removed and some neighbouring bins are combined together to generate a new feature component to maximize the discriminative ability. The mutual information is adopted to evaluate the discriminative power of a specific feature set and an iterative algorithm is performed to derive the histogram quantization and their corresponding feature generation. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature representation, an application of detecting adult images, i.e., image classification between erotic and benign images, is carried out. Two widely used classification techniques, SVM and Adaboost, are employed as the classifier.

The quantization of weights and feature maps (activations) is a popular approach to solve this problem. Training-aware quantization often shows excellent results but requires a full dataset, which is not always available. Post-training quantization methods, in turn, are applied without fine-tuning but still work well for many classes of tasks like classification, segmentation, and so on. However, they either imply a big overhead for quantization parameters (QPs) calculation at runtime (dynamic methods) or lead to an accuracy drop if pre-computed static QPs are used (static methods). Moreover, most inference frame-works don’t support dynamic quantization. Thus we propose a novel quantization approach called QPP: quantization parameter prediction. With a small subset of a training dataset or unlabeled data from the same domain, we find the predictor that can accurately estimate QPs of activations given only the NN’s input data. Such a predictor allows us to avoid complex calculation of precise values of QPs while maintaining the quality of the model. To illustrate our method’s efficiency, we added QPP into two dynamic approaches: 1) Dense+Sparse quantization, where the predetermined percentage of activations are not quantized, 2) standard quantization with equal quantization steps. We provide experiments on a wide set of tasks including super-resolution, facial landmark, segmentation, and classification.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-4509-2","10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9578348","","Deep learning;Training;Quantization (signal);Runtime;Superresolution;Predictive models;Stability analysis","computational complexity;data compression;deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;image resolution;mobile computing;quantisation (signal);vector quantisation","QPP;real-time quantization parameter prediction;modern deep neural networks;mobile embedded devices;computational complexity;power consumption;feature maps;training-aware quantization;post-training quantization methods;quantization parameters calculation;dynamic methods;accuracy drop;static methods;inference frameworks;dynamic quantization;quantization approach;training dataset;unlabeled data;complex calculation;method;dynamic approaches;equal quantization steps;NN input data;precomputed static QP","","","","25","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a realistic example (e.g., speech parameter coding), we discuss joint source-channel decoding for auto-correlated continuous-amplitude source samples. At the transmitter, the source samples are quantized and their indexes are appropriately mapped onto bitvectors. Afterwards, the bits are interleaved and channel-encoded; an AWGN channel is assumed for transmission. The auto-correlations of the source samples act as implicit outer channel codes that are serially concatenated with the inner explicit channel code. Thus, by applying the turbo principle, we can perform iterative decoding at the receiver. As an example, we show that, with a proper bit mapping for a 5-bit quantizer, iterative source-channel decoding saves up to 2 dB in channel SNR or 8 dB in source SNR for an auto-correlated Gaussian source.","","0-7803-7799-0","10.1109/ITW.2003.1216747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1216747","","Probability;Integrated circuit modeling;Iterative decoding;Random variables;Power system modeling;Noise figure;Autocorrelation;Distortion;Transmitters;Information analysis","iterative decoding;combined source-channel coding;quantisation (signal);interleaved codes;AWGN channels;correlation methods;concatenated codes","turbo principle;joint source-channel coding;iterative decoding;speech coding;joint source-channel decoding;source samples;vectors;interleaved codes;AWGN channel;concatenated codes;SNR;auto-correlated Gaussian source","","26","1","7","","4 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The implementation, called Voltx, produces high-quality images at nearly interactive speeds on workstations with hardware support for three-dimensional texture maps. Previously reported methods did not incorporate a light model, and did not address issues of multiple texture maps for large volumes. Our research shows that these extensions impact performance by about a factor of ten. Voltx supports orthographic, perspective, and stereo views. This paper describes the theory and implementation of this technique, and compares it to the shear-warp factorization approach. A rectilinear data set is converted into a three-dimensional texture map containing color and opacity information. Quantized normal vectors and a lookup table provide efficiency. A new tesselation of the sphere is described, which serves as the basis for normal-vector quantization. A new gradient-based shading criterion is described, in which the gradient magnitude is interpreted in the context of the field-data value and the material classification parameters, and not in isolation.

Among these components, vertices require large storage space. In conventional 2-D video compression algorithms, motion compensation (MC) using a block matching algorithm is frequently employed to reduce temporal redundancy between consecutive frames. However, there has been no such technology for 3-D time-varying mesh so far. Therefore, in this paper, we have developed an extended block matching algorithm (EBMA) to reduce the temporal redundancy of the geometry information in the time-varying mesh by extending the idea of the 2-D block matching algorithm to 3-D space. In our EBMA, a cubic block is used as a matching unit. MC in the 3-D space is achieved efficiently by matching the mean normal vectors calculated from partial surfaces in cubic blocks, which our experiments showed to be a suboptimal matching criterion.

Under the former strategy, each user's message is multicast from the central processor (CP) to all the serving remote radio heads (RRHs) over the fronthaul network, which then cooperatively serve the users through joint beamforming; while under the latter strategy, the user messages are first beamformed then quantized at the CP, and the compressed signal is unicast to the corresponding RRH, which then decompresses its received signal for wireless transmission. Previous works show that in general the compression-based strategy outperforms the data-sharing strategy. This paper, on the other hand, points out that in a C-RAN model where the RRHs are connected to the CP via multihop routers, data-sharing can be superior to compression if the network coding technique is adopted for multicasting user messages to the cooperating RRHs, and the RRH's beamforming vectors, the user-RRH association, and the network coding design over the fronthaul network are jointly optimized based on the techniques of sparse optimization and successive convex approximation. This is in comparison to the compression-based strategy, where information is unicast over the fronthaul network by simple routing, and the RRH's compression noise covariance and beamforming vectors, as well as the routing strategy over the fronthaul network are jointly optimized based on the successive convex approximation technique. The observed gain in overall network throughput is due to that information multicast is more efficient than information unicast over the multihop fronthaul of a C-RAN.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2017.2649486","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809154","Cloud radio access network (C-RAN);cross-layer design;data-sharing strategy;compression-based strategy;beamforming;network coding;routing;fronthaul constraints;sparse optimization;successive convex approximation","Downlink;Routing;Array signal processing;Spread spectrum communication;Network coding;Throughput;Unicast","array signal processing;network coding;radio access networks;RSSI","downlink multihop cloud radio access networks;network coding;cross-layer design;downlink communication;data-sharing strategy;compression-based strategy;central processor;remote radio heads;compressed signal;received signal;wireless transmission;multihop routers;user message multicasting;RRH beamforming vectors;user-RRH association;fronthaul network;sparse optimization;successive convex approximation;RRH compression noise covariance","","33","","22","IEEE","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We formulate the sensor selection problem as the design of a sparse selection vector. The cardinality of the selection vector is added as a sparsity-promoting penalty term to the cost function where the conditional posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound is used as the criterion for sensor selection. To cope with large-scale WSNs, by combining iterative reweighted ℓ1-norm minimization with the accelerated proximal gradient method and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we develop two efficient sensor selection algorithms, respectively. We further develop a low-complexity distributed version of the ADMM where each sensor makes a local sensor selection decision.

In frequency division duplexing systems, the equivalent channel has to be fed back to the base station (BS) via a feedback channel based on a codebook. However, no dedicated codebook has been proposed for LAA-aided mmWave systems. To fill this gap, in this letter, we propose a reduced-dimensional subspace codebook (RDSC) for such systems. Specifically, under the recently proposed concept of angle coherence time, we first generate the large-dimensional vectors in the channel subspace, which is determined by the angles-of-departure of the dominant paths. Then, based on these vectors in the channel subspace, we create the RDSC by considering both the lens and the beam selector. Finally, the equivalent channel is quantized using the proposed RDSC and fed back to the BS. Finally, we carry out mathematical performance analysis of the proposed RDSC and show that its feedback overhead is rendered proportional to the relatively small number of dominant paths per user.

The state-of-the-art powerful global descriptor for this purpose is Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD). Given a set of local features (say, SIFT) extracted from an image, the VLAD is generated by quantizing local features with a small visual vocabulary (64 to 512 centroids), aggregating the residual statistics of quantized features for each centroid and concatenating the aggregated residual vectors from each centroid. One can increase the search accuracy by increasing the size of vocabulary (from hundreds to hundreds of thousands), which, however, it leads to heavy computation cost with flat quantization. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-VLAD to seek the tradeoff between descriptor discriminability and computation complexity. We build up a tree-structured hierarchical quantization (TSHQ) to accelerate the VLAD computation with a large vocabulary. As quantization error may propagate from root to leaf node (centroid) with TSHQ, we introduce multi-VLAD, which constructing a VLAD descriptor for each level of the vocabulary tree, so as to compensate for the quantization error at that level. Extensive evaluation over benchmark datasets has shown that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art in terms of retrieval accuracy, fast extraction, as well as light memory cost.","","978-1-4799-8339-1","10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351684","Image Retrieval;Hierarchical Quantization;Multi-VLAD","Quantization (signal);Vocabulary;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Visualization;Kernel;Benchmark testing","computational complexity;data compression;feature extraction;image coding;image retrieval;tree data structures;vocabulary","computation complexity;vocabulary tree;quantization error;TSHQ;tree-structured hierarchical quantization;visual vocabulary;feature extraction;vector-of-locally aggregated descriptor;discriminative feature descriptor;image retrieval;hierarchical multiVLAD descriptor","","4","","19","","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce a new method for clustering 2D images of gene expression patterns in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryos. These patterns, typically generated from in situ hybridization of mRNA probes, reveal when, where and how abundantly a target gene is expressed. Our method involves two steps. First, we use an eigen-embryo model to reduce noise and generate feature vectors that form a better basis for capturing the salient aspects of quantized embryo images. Second, we cluster these feature vectors by an efficient minimum-spanning-tree partition algorithm. We investigate this approach on fly embryo datasets that span the entire course of embryogenesis. The experimental results show that our clustering algorithm produces superior pattern clusters.

The approximation coefficients are encoded directly with lossless encoding technique. In the case of detailed coefficients, their sparse representations are obtained using learned dictionary and these sparse vectors are quantized and encoded. Inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) is applied with the estimated detail and approximation coefficients at the decompression stage, to retrieve back the decompressed image.

EEAC-SV relies on the QoS information in the pre-marked probing packet to select the optimal service vector. However, owing to the overhead constraint, the QoS information in the probing packet can only be conveyed in a quantized manner. The mathematical model indicates that with the same amount of overhead, the performance of EEAC-SV can be optimized with the proper packet marking strategy. In this paper, we propose the smart packet marking strategy to improve the EEAC-SV performance in terms of reducing the false routing probability. Smart packet marking is a stochastic solution which, based on the knowledge of the history of network QoS performances and user behaviors, defines the boundaries of each quantization level in such a way to improve the routing accuracy. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that smart packet marking outperforms the packet marking strategy that does not take stochastic information into consideration.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150948","","Quality of service;Probability distribution;Routing;Admission control;Stochastic processes;Data communication;Measurement;Delay effects;Laboratories;Spread spectrum communication","DiffServ networks;quality of service;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network routing","smart packet marking strategy;EEAC-SV;explicit endpoint admission control-service vector;multihop connection;Diffserv network;QoS;false routing probability;quantization","","","","7","","16 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, the weight of a pixel is inversely proportional to the distance between the pixel and the keypoint. Color is the most intuitive feature of image and one of the visual perception features. Therefore, a novel Gaussian weight color representation named gColor is proposed in the article, which is obtained by assigning different weights to the color vectors of the pixels in a patch.

The high non-linear distortion due to coarse quantization leads to severe performance degradation in conventional OFDM receivers, which necessitates novel receiver techniques. Firstly, we derive the Bayesian Cramr-Rao-lower-bound (CRLB) on the mean squared error (MSE) in recovering jointly compressible vectors from quantized noisy underdetermined measurements. Secondly, we formulate the pilot-assisted channel estimation as a multiple measurement vector (MMV) sparse recovery problem, and propose a variational Bayes (VB) algorithm to infer the posterior distribution of the channel. We benchmark the MSE performance of our algorithm with that of the CRLB, and numerically show that the VB algorithm meets the CRLB. Thirdly, we propose a soft symbol decoding algorithm that infers the posterior distributions of the data symbols given the quantized observations. We utilize the posterior statistics of the detected data symbols as virtual pilots, and propose an iterative soft symbol decoding and data-aided channel estimation procedure. Finally, we propose a variant of the iterative algorithm that utilizes the output bit log-likelihood ratios of the channel decoder to adapt the data prior to further improve the performance.

In the baseline method, two keypoints are considered as a matching pair if their SIFT descriptors are quantized to the same visual word. However, the SIFT visual word has two limitations. First, it loses most of its discriminative power during quantization. Second, SIFT only describes the local texture feature. Both drawbacks impair the discriminative power of the BoW model and lead to false positive matches. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes to embed multiple binary features at indexing level. To model correlation between features, a multi-IDF scheme is introduced, through which different binary features are coupled into the inverted file. We show that matching verification methods based on binary features, such as Hamming embedding, can be effectively incorporated in our framework. As an extension, we explore the fusion of binary color feature into image retrieval. The joint integration of the SIFT visual word and binary features greatly enhances the precision of visual matching, reducing the impact of false positive matches. Our method is evaluated through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Ukbench, Holidays, DupImage, and MIR Flickr 1M). We show that our method significantly improves the baseline approach. In addition, large-scale experiments indicate that the proposed method requires acceptable memory usage and query time compared with other approaches.

However, when labeled and unlabeled images are sampled from different distributions, they may be quantized into different visual words of the codebook and encoded with different representations, which may severely degrade classification performance. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Sparse Coding (TSC) approach to construct robust sparse representations for classifying cross-distribution images accurately. Specifically, we aim to minimize the distribution divergence between the labeled and unlabeled images, and incorporate this criterion into the objective function of sparse coding to make the new representations robust to the distribution difference.

First, coset quantized DCT coefficients and motion data are directly delivered to the channel coding layer without syndrome or entropy coding. Second, transmission power is directly allocated to coset data and motion data according to their distributions and magnitudes without forward error correction. Third, these data are transformed by Hadamard and then directly mapped using a dense constellation (64K-QAM) for transmission without Gray coding. One of the most important properties in this framework is that the coding and transmission rate is fixed and distortion is minimized by allocating the transmission power. Thus, we further propose a power distortion optimization algorithm to replace the traditional rate distortion optimization. This framework avoids the annoying cliff effect caused by the mismatch between transmission rate and channel condition. In multicast, each user can get approximately the best quality matching its channel condition. Our experiment results show that the proposed DCast outperforms the typical solution using H.264 over 802.11 up to 8 dB in video PSNR in video broadcast.

In this paper, we propose a new channel quantization strategy to optimize the performance of the IA with limited feedback. In our proposed scheme, we introduce an additional receive filter to minimize the chordal distance which accounts for the quantization error on Grassmann manifold. Besides, we analyze a reduction in terms of the chordal distance in our scheme compared to conventional methods. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme provides substantially better performance than the conventional method as the number of feedback bits is increased.

In this paper we assume that the harvested energy at each time, the total battery storage, and the transmitter signal energy at each time can be quantized to the same unit (i.e., the same energy interval). Under this assumption, we show that the capacity can be described using the Verdú-Han general framework. If we further assume that the transmitted symbol at each time depends only on the energy currently available, and not on the entire past history of energy harvests and symbols transmitted, then we show that the system reduces to a finite state channel (FSC) with the required ergodic and Markov properties so that lower bounds on the capacity can be readily numerically computed.

A scene recording is then transformed into a label-tree embedding image. Elements of the image represent the likelihoods that the scene instance belongs to the metaclasses. We investigate classification with label-tree embedding features learned from different low-level features as well as their fusion. We show that the combination of multiple features is essential to obtain good performance. While averaging label-tree embedding images over time yields good performance, we argue that average pooling possesses an intrinsic shortcoming. We alternatively propose an improved classification scheme to bypass this limitation. We aim at automatically learning common templates that are useful for the classification task from these images using simple but tailored convolutional neural networks. The trained networks are then employed as a feature extractor that matches the learned templates across a label-tree embedding image and produce the maximum matching scores as features for classification. Since audio scenes exhibit rich content, template learning and matching on low-level features would be inefficient. With label-tree embedding features, we have quantized and reduced the low-level features into the likelihoods of the metaclasses, on which the template learning and matching are efficient.

The quantized data are transmitted through binary symmetric channels to a fusion center where a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector is employed to perform a global decision.

Transmit beamforming with limited feedback systems estimate the channel at the receiver and send quantized channel state or beamformer information to the transmitter. A different approach that exploits the spatio-temporal correlation of the channel is proposed here. The transmitter periodically sends a beamformed pilot signal in the downlink, while the receiver quantizes the corresponding received signal and feeds back the bits to the transmitter. Assuming an autoregressive (AR) channel model, Kalman filtering (KF) based on the sign of innovations (SOI) is proposed for channel tracking, and closed-form expressions for the channel estimation mean-squared error (MSE) are derived under certain conditions. For more general channel models, a novel tracking approach is proposed that exploits the quantization bits in a maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. Simulations show that close to optimum performance can be attained with only 2 bits per channel dwell time block, even for systems with many transmit antennas. This clears a hurdle for transmit beamforming with many antennas in FDD mode-which was almost impossible with the prior state-of-art.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2014.2365762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6937178","Beamforming;estimation;Kalman filtering;limited-rate feedback;quantization;time-varying channels","Array signal processing;Receivers;Transmitters;Channel estimation;Downlink;Correlation;Vectors","array signal processing;channel estimation;correlation methods;Kalman filters;maximum likelihood estimation;mean square error methods;radio receivers;radio transmitters;state feedback;transmitting antennas","channel tracking;transmit beamforming systems;frugal feedback;channel state feedback;frequency-division duplex mode;limited feedback systems;channel spatio-temporal correlation;autoregressive channel model;Kalman filtering;sign-of-innovations;SOI;closed-form expressions;channel estimation mean-squared error;MSE;maximum a posteriori formulation;channel dwell time block;transmit antennas;FDD mode;multiple-input multiple-output systems;MIMO systems","","22","1","21","IEEE","28 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, industrial field trials show rather disappointing throughput gains, whereby the major limiting factor is proper sharing of channel state information. Many recent papers have considered this so-called limited feedback problem in the context of CoMP, usually taking the following assumptions, namely, infinite SNR regime, no user selection, and ideal link adaptation, rendering the analysis too optimistic. In this paper, we make a step forward toward a more realistic assessment of the limited feedback problem by introducing an improved metric for the performance evaluation, which better captures the throughput degradation. We find the relevant scaling laws (lower and upper bounds) and show that they are different from existing ones. Moreover, we provide a robust iterative interference alignment algorithm and corresponding feedback strategies achieving the obtained scaling laws. The main idea is that, instead of sending the complete channel matrix, each user fixes a receive filter and feeds back a quantized version of the effective channel. Finally, we underline our findings with simulations for the proposed system.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2361335","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(grant numbers:01BU920); European Commission(grant numbers:FP7-ICT-2011-8,318555 5GNOW); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(grant numbers:JU-2795-1&2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915866","Channel state feedback;finite-rate feedback;interference alignment;MIMO communication;cellular systems","Base stations;Interference;Array signal processing;Measurement;Vectors;Throughput;Optimal scheduling","cellular radio;iterative methods;radio spectrum management;radiofrequency interference","cellular networks;coordinated multipoint transmission;CoMP;spectral efficiency;channel state information;limited feedback problem;infinite SNR regime;no user selection;ideal link adaptation;throughput degradation;robust iterative interference alignment algorithm;channel matrix;receive filter;performance evaluation","","19","","24","IEEE","3 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We consider two types of noise models: input noise, where noise enters before the random projection, and output noise, where noise enters after the random projection. Sign pattern recovery involves the estimation of sign pattern of a sparse signal. Our idea is to pretend that no noise exists and solve the noiseless ℓ1 problem, namely, min ||β||1 s.t. y - Gβ and quantizing the resulting solution. We show that the quantized solution perfectly reconstructs the sign pattern of a sufficiently sparse signal. Specifically, we show that the sign pattern of an arbitrary k-sparse, n-dimensional signal x can be recovered with SNR - Ω(log n) and measurements scaling as m = Ώ,(log n /k) for all sparsity levels k satisfying 0 <; k ≤ an, where a is a sufficiently small positive constant. Surprisingly, this bound matches the optimal Max-Likelihood performance bounds in terms of SNR, re quired number of measurements, and admissible sparsity level in an order-wise sense. In contrast to our results, previous results based on LASSO and Max-Correlation techniques either assume significantly larger SNR, sub-linear sparsity levels or restrictive assumptions on signal sets. Our proof technique is based on noisy perturbation of the noiseless ℓ1 problem, in that, we estimate the maximum admissible noise level before sign pattern recovery fails.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2104512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714267","Approximate sparsity;compressed sensing;LASSO;linear programming;sign-pattern recovery","Signal to noise ratio;Noise measurement;Correlation;Sensors;Linear programming;Vectors","correlation methods;linear programming;signal reconstruction;sparse matrices","thresholded basis pursuit;LP algorithm;order-wise optimal support recovery;approximately sparse signals;noisy random measurements;linear programming;sign pattern recovery;noisy random projections;pattern reconstruction;k-sparse;n-dimensional signal;max-likelihood;max-correlation;noisy perturbation","","18","","27","IEEE","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These two distinct properties make sliding-mode modulation an attractive substitute for other modulation schemes such as pulsewidth modulation and sigma-delta modulation.

This variational method was shown to be superior to all other state-of-the art ordering algorithms in terms of faithful total strict ordering but not in speed. Indeed, the relevant functionals are in general difficult to minimize because their gradient is nearly flat over vast regions. In this paper, we propose a simple and fast fixed point algorithm to minimize these functionals. The fast convergence of our algorithm results from known analytical properties of the model. Our algorithm is equivalent to an iterative nonlinear filtering. Furthermore, we show that a particular form of the variational model gives rise to much faster convergence than other alternative forms. We demonstrate that only a few iterations of this filter yield almost the same pixel ordering as the minimizer. Thus, we apply only few iteration steps to obtain images, whose pixels can be ordered in a strict and faithful way.

The HS image (HSI) consumes a great amount of storage space and transmission time. Hence, it would be desirable to reduce the image representation to the extent possible using a compression method appropriate to the usage and processing of the image. Many compression methods have been proposed aiming at different applications and fields. This research focuses on the lossy compression of images that contain subpixel targets. This target type requires minimum compression loss over the spatial dimension in order to preserve the target, and the maximum possible spectral compression that would still enable target detection. For this target type, we propose the PCA-DCT (principle component analysis followed by the discrete cosine transform) compression method. It combines the PCA's ability to extract the background from a small number of components, with the individual spectral compression of each pixel of the residual image, obtained by excluding the background from the HSI, using quantized DCT coefficients. The compression method is kept simple for fast processing and implementation, and considers lossy compression only on the spectral axis. The spectral compression achieves a compression ratio of over 20. The popular Reed-Xiaoli (RX) algorithm and the improved quasi-local RX (RXQLC) are used as target detection methods. The detection performance is evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve generation. The proposed compression method achieves maintained and enhanced detection performance, compared to the detection performance of the original image, mainly due to its inherent smoothing and noise reduction effects. Our proposed method is also compared with two other compression methods: PCA-ICA (independent component analysis) and band decimation (BandDec), yielding superior results for high compression rates.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2320754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822548","Discrete cosine transforms (DCT);hyperspectral image (HSI);principal component analysis (PCA);RX (Reed Xiaoli) algorithm;spectral compression;Discrete cosine transforms (DCT);hyperspectral image (HSI);principal component analysis (PCA);RX (Reed Xiaoli) algorithm;spectral compression","Image coding;Discrete cosine transforms;Principal component analysis;Vectors;Object detection;Quantization (signal)","data compression;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image coding","hyperspectral image compression;subpixel target;hyperspectral image sensors;pixel reflectance;storage space;transmission time;compression method;image processing;image usage;compression methods;image lossy compression;maximum possible spectral compression;PCA-DCT compression method;principle component analysis;discrete cosine transform;residual image pixel;spectral axis;popular Reed-Xiaoli algorithm;receiver operating characteristics;ROC curve generation;band decimation","","16","","25","IEEE","29 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose an efficient CSI quantization technique for BD preceded systems with limited feedback where users supported by a base station are selected by dynamic scheduling. First, we express the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) when multiple data streams are transmitted to the user, and derive a lower bound expression of the expected received SINR at each user. Then, based on this measure, each user determines its quantized CSI feedback information which maximizes the derived expected SINR, which comprises both the channel direction and the amplitude information.

Under a Gaussian noise assumption, it is known that the three-parameter fit given in IEEE Standards 1057 and 1241 coincides with the method of maximum likelihood (ML), which is known for its favorable properties in large samples. Under coherent sampling assumption, the Cramér-Rao Bound of an unbiased estimator (UE) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is derived followed by an exact finite-sample analysis of the ML estimator of SNR derived from the three-parameter fit, revealing its nonsymmetric F-distribution. Exact expressions for the bias, variance, and the mean squared error (MSE) of the ML estimator are then derived, revealing that the ML estimator in finite samples is far from optimal in terms of precision and accuracy. With the ML estimator as a starting point, several alternative estimators are derived, which outperform the method of ML. In particular, a UE is derived, with lower variance compared with the ML for small sample size. In addition, estimators are derived based on constrained minimization of the MSE.

Due to the high complexity of finding an optimal feedback policy under the 4R-V state, we consider a reduced 2-V state. As opposed to a previous study that assumes the feedback problem under such a 2-V state remaining an MDP formulation, our analysis indicates that the underlying problem is no longer an MDP. Nonetheless, the approximation as an MDP is shown to be justifiable and efficient. Based on the quantized 2-V state and the MDP approximation, we propose practical implementation algorithms for feedback control with unknown state transition probabilities. In particular, we provide model-based offline and online learning algorithms, as well as a model-free learning algorithm.

This model is used to define a matching cost obtained by applying a rigid-body transformation to the 3D object model, projecting it onto the image plane, and matching the projected model to HOG features extracted from the input image. Our second contribution is a very efficient branch-and-bound algorithm for finding the 3D pose that maximizes the matching score. For this, 3D integral images of quantized HOGs are employed to evaluate in constant time the maximum attainable matching scores of individual model primitives.

The quality of speech reproduced by a CELP coder can be improved by making spectral transitions as smooth and continuous as possible. One way in which this can be accomplished without increasing the transmission bit rate is to interpolate the LPC spectral parameters between adjacent extraction frames. This, however, usually leads to a dramatic increase in the computations required for the codebook search. The paper presents a new LPC interpolation technique, based on interpolating the impulse response of the LPC synthesis filter. It demonstrates that this method offers a significant complexity reduction for the codebook search over other typical interpolation schemes. Furthermore, the experiments show that the coder using the impulse response for interpolation produces the same speech quality as the coder using the LSP parameters for interpolation, and both these parameter sets are superior to other LPC representations for interpolation.<>","1558-0857","","10.1109/26.275298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=275298","","Linear predictive coding;Interpolation;Speech synthesis;Filters;Vectors;Telecommunication computing;Filtering;Bit rate;Speech coding;Decoding","linear predictive coding;speech coding;interpolation;transient response;speech intelligibility;filtering and prediction theory","LPC interpolation;CELP coders;code-excited linear predictive coders;low rate coders;LPC spectral information;speech quality;spectral transitions;transmission bit rate;LPC spectral parameters;extraction frames;codebook search;impulse response;LPC synthesis filter;complexity reduction;speech coding","","5","3","12","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We examine a coding scheme that combines sampling and noise-shaped quantization for a scenario in which only K <;L descriptions or all L descriptions are received. Some of the received K-sets of descriptions correspond to uniform sampling while others to non-uniform sampling. This scheme achieves the optimum rate-distortion performance for uniform-sampling K-sets, but suffers noise amplification for nonuniform-sampling K-sets.

If an early warning system is available to predict the risk with a loan well-ahead of time, the agency can potentially take corrective measures to prevent the loan from defaulting. In this paper, we use a partial least squares (PLS) regression to model the status of a loan quantized to a non-linear scale of 0 to 100 (where the severity function is built with inputs from domain experts). We use the associated ""Variable Influence on Projection"" or VIP scores to select the useful variables for better prediction. In order to address the imbalance in the categories of the observed records (typically the number of low risk records are much more than the risky records), we propose a multi-PLS model for loan prediction.

We assume that users feed CSI back to its local BS which forwards it to the other cooperating BSs using backhaul connections. In case of feedback and backhaul latency, CSI of a single user equipment (UE) is affected by multiple delays. Compensating for the delay via channel prediction raises the question of where to place the predictor. Prediction at the UE before the channel observations are quantized allows to compensate only for a single delay. Prediction at the BS side keeps the flexibility to compensate for the actual delay at each base station, at the drawback that less accurate information is available due to feedback quantization. This paper extends previous work from a transmission over uncorrelated subcarriers to the more realistic transmission over correlated subcarriers. Previously, we have shown that prediction before and after quantization results in the same channel uncertainty. As a consequence, prediction at the BS is always preferable if multiple delays need to be compensated. This paper shows that this result remains valid also for correlated subcarriers.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-0356-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6638623","","Delays;Quantization (signal);Vectors;Channel estimation;Downlink;Noise measurement;Gold","cellular radio;cooperative communication;radio links;wireless channels","cooperative multi-cell downlink transmission;channel state information;CSI;BS;single user equipment;UE Prediction;base station;feedback quantization;uncorrelated subcarrier;correlated subcarrier","","4","","17","","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The received SNR is used as the design metric. We study two types of codebook design: phase-only codebook where each relay uses full power, and codebook with power control where relay power and phase need to be jointly considered. For the former, we adopt Grassmannian line packing criterion under equal gain constraint, and compare the performance with that under the generalized Lloyd Algorithm for optimal codebook design. For codebook with power control, the generalized Lloyd Algorithm can be used for the optimal codebook design, but incurs high complexity. We propose a low-complexity suboptimal method, which can directly use the optimal power control solution for perfect channel knowledge under the individual power constraint. Through simulation study, it is found that it is more beneficial to use codebook with power control over codebook without power control when relays are closer to destination, instead of the source.","2377-8644","978-1-4673-2815-9","10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356901","","Relays;Power control;Array signal processing;Vectors;Signal to noise ratio;Algorithm design and analysis;Quantization","array signal processing;cooperative communication;optimal control;phase coding;power control;radio networks;telecommunication control","distributed relay beamforming network;relay power constraint;cooperative relay network;SNR;phase-only codebook;Grassmannian line packing criterion;equal gain constraint;optimal codebook design;generalized Lloyd algorithm;low-complexity suboptimal method;perfect channel knowledge;optimal power control solution","","3","","17","","24 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples of observation models that do not satisfy these conditions are given. It is demonstrated that the locally optimum quantizer design for the time-invariant breakpoint constraint is the same as that quantizer design that minimizes the time-average mean-square difference between the quantizer and the locally optimum time-varying nonlinearity.

The effectiveness is unclear as well. This paper proposes a practical spatial re-ranking method for video instance search. We make two contributions to speed up the algorithm: One is to select the most representative image/frame for spatial verification, based on the available Bag-of-Words representation; the other is to efficiently build tentative matching feature pairs, which serve as the input of the RANSAC algorithm, by regarding features quantized to the same visual word as matches, thus avoid the costly nearest-neighbor search. These two modifications lead one order of magnitude speedup without compromising the performance. Another contribution is a ROI-originated RANSAC method, which improves the re-ranking performance significantly.

In addition, the eigenvector is unique to the environment of propagation due to indoor reflection and diffraction of the electric wave. The conventional method based on fingerprinting does not take previous information into account. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that applies HMM to conventional fingerprinting of the eigenvector. This algorithm takes previous state of estimation into account by comparing the eigenvector obtained during observation with the one stored in the database. The database has the eigenvector obtained at each reference location according to setting in advance. In an indoor environment represented in a quantized grid, we decide the HMM transition probabilities denoting the possible moving range from previous estimation location. The most likely trajectory is calculated by means of the Viterbi algorithm. The results show that the localization accuracy is improved owing to the use of a possible moving range from the previous location.","2166-9589","978-1-4673-2569-1","10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6362772","","Hidden Markov models;Arrays;Accuracy;Estimation;Databases;Correlation;Vectors","antenna arrays;direction-of-arrival estimation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","hidden Markov model;localization;array antenna;eigenvector spanning signal subspace;received signal strength;direction of arrival;incident signals;indoor reflection;electric wave;fingerprinting","","3","","11","","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem is posed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the goal of minimizing the average packet error rate (PER). The performance of a myopic policy is compared with that of the POMDP solution, and it is shown that the former is optimal under certain conditions. As the POMDP approach requires the channel gains to be quantized to a finite set of states, we also propose two heuristic AS schemes that use the continuous-valued received pilot symbols to make AS decisions, and thereby offer comparable or better performance than the POMDP approach. Unlike previous work, the schemes proposed here for AS do not require a lengthy AS training phase to precede each data packet. The performance improvement offered by the POMDP solution and the proposed heuristic solutions relative to existing AS training-based approaches is illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations.","1930-529X","978-1-4799-3512-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037408","Antenna selection;POMDP;myopic policy;finite state Markov chain","Training;Signal to noise ratio;Antennas;Receivers;Doppler effect;Vectors;Channel estimation","antenna arrays;correlation methods;demodulation;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;receiving antennas;wireless channels","POMDP;receive antenna selection;PER minimization;multiple antenna communication system;single radio frequency chain;per-packet basis;AS decisions;noisy channel gain estimation;data packet;coherent demodulation;time correlation;partially observable Markov decision process;average packet error rate minimization;continuous-valued received pilot symbols;Monte Carlo simulations","","1","","29","","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this regard, precoding in multiuser-multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink systems is a prominent example. In frequency division duplex, channel observations are quantized and fed back via the uplink, protected by an error correction code. The quantization resolution together with the code strength correspond to a certain amount of feedback bits. For a limited number of uplink signaling resources, there is a trade-off between investing bits for increasing the quantization resolution or for improving the error correction capability. While existing feedback schemes use a fixed quantization resolution, this work proposes a scheme which finds the optimal number of quantization bits for minimizing the channel uncertainty at the transmitter.

Traditionally, visual codebook is generated by clustering local features into groups, and the original feature is hard quantized to its nearest centers. It is known that the quantization error may degrade the effectiveness of the BoW representation. To address this problem, several soft quantization based methods have been proposed in literature. However, the effectiveness of these methods is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective image representation method based on a bi-layer codebook. In this method, we first construct the bi-layer codebook to explicitly reduce the quantization error. And then, inspired by the locality-constrained linear coding method[18], we propose a ridge regression based quantization to assign multiple visual words to the local feature. Furthermore, the k nearest neighbor strategy is integrated to improve the efficiency of quantization.

In this paper, we answer the above two questions by investigating the performance of learning to rank for the large-scale content based image retrieval problem, with some scalable visual based ranking features proposed to improve the performance. Specifically, we firstly adopt several well performed ad-hoc ranking models to generate the Bag-of-Visual-Words based ranking features. Additionally, to preserve the spatial information of image local descriptors, we split images into blocks from coarse to fine, and extract ranking features hierarchically with a spatial pyramid manner. Finally, image global features are also quantized via LSH and concatenated with the existing ranking features all together.

Therefore, the automatic computer-aided lesion classification technique is highly perspective needed. In this paper, we propose an effective scheme to classify different lesion images acquired by WCE. Firstly, we obtain feature maps of the same resolution by performing a max pooling operation on different convolutional layers, and then quantify the pooled feature maps by trainable weight parameters, and finally one by one convolution kernels are employed to merge the combined quantized feature maps. We enhance the performance of feature extraction by merging multi-level convolutional features, including both low level and high level features. The preliminary experimental result shows that the classification accuracy rate is up to 95.15%, both running speed and recognition rate are higher than traditional machine learning algorithms.","","978-1-5386-8339-2","10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8780859","wireless capsule endoscopy;feature extraction;lesion classification;deep convolutional neural network","Feature extraction;Convolution;Lesions;Training;Kernel;Support vector machines;Image classification","biomedical optical imaging;diseases;endoscopes;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets","gastrointestinal tract;WCE images;lesion images;convolutional layers;classification accuracy rate;multilevel convolutional features;feature extraction;convolution kernels;automatic computer-aided lesion classification technique;video data;noninvasive gastrointestinal disease detection;patient-friendly equipment;wireless capsule endoscopy;deep convolutional neural networks;capsule endoscopy image classification","","1","","25","","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quantization is considered a necessary step to digitalize signals and realize the high-efficient transmission of digital signals. As a new signal processing theory, compressed sensing (CS) which is promoted as a joint sampling and compression approach for sparse signals has caused wide public concern in the field of image processing. In a practical application, although quantization is unavoidable for CS measurements, CS literature has largely avoided to discuss the topic of quantization. In this paper, differential pulse-code modulation(DPCM) is coupled with nonuniform scalar quantization(nonuniform SQ) to provide block-based compressed sensing (BCS) quantization of images. This paper analyzes the distribution of prediction errors in DPCM framework and draws a conclusion that in statistical sense such distribution is consistent with the characteristics of nonuniform scalar quantization. This discovery provides a theoretical basis for the proposed quantization method. Experimental results show that the proposed quantization scheme effectively increases the quantized signal to noise ratio(SNR), meanwhile improves the quality of reconstructed images.","","978-1-4799-5458-2","10.1109/ICSAI.2014.7009392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009392","block compressed sensing;DPCM;quantization;image processing","Quantization (signal);Image reconstruction;Image coding;Vectors;Size measurement;Current measurement;Rate-distortion","compressed sensing;image reconstruction;pulse code modulation;quantisation (signal)","nonuniform quantization;block-based compressed sensing;differential pulse-code modulation;signal processing;digital signals;image processing;CS measurements;nonuniform scalar quantization;BCS quantization;prediction errors distribution;signal to noise ratio;SNR;reconstructed images","","1","","16","","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this case, transmitting to multiple users will typically cause interference among them, which degrades the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).

We focus on an extension of the conventional centralized CSI at the TX (CSIT) model, where instead of having a single channel estimate, or quantized version, perfectly shared by all the TX antennas, each TX receives its own estimate of the global multiuser channel. This CSIT configuration, denoted as distributed CSIT, is particularly suited to model the joint transmission from TXs which are not colocated. With centralized CSIT, a very important design guideline for the feedback link was provided by Jindal [Trans. Inf. Theory 2006] by providing a sufficient feedback rate to ensure that the rate loss stays below a maximum value. In the distributed CSIT setting, additional errors occur and the design guidelines for the centralized case are no longer valid. Consequently, we obtain a new relation between the rate loss and the number of feedback bits. Interestingly, the feedback rate derived in the distributed CSIT setting is roughly K log2(K) bits larger than its counterpart in the centralized case. This highlights the critical impact of the CSIT distributedness over the performance.","1948-3252","978-1-4673-5577-3","10.1109/SPAWC.2013.6612038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612038","","Interference;Quantization (signal);Channel estimation;Wireless communication;Signal to noise ratio;Conferences;Vectors","broadcast channels;channel estimation;receivers;telecommunication links;transmitters;transmitting antennas","rate loss analysis;transmitter cooperation;distributed CSIT;channel state information;broadcast channel;BC;transmitting antenna;single-antenna receiver;TX model;channel estimation;single-antenna transmitter;CSI at the TX model;feedback link;single-antenna RX","","","","17","","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The motivation stems from the fact that spectrograms form recognisable images, that can be identified by a human reader, with perception enhanced by pseudo-coloration of the image. The signal processing in our method is as follows. 1) The spectrogram is normalised into greyscale with a fixed range. 2) The dynamic range is quantized into regions, each of which is then mapped to form a monochrome image. 3) The monochrome images are partitioned into blocks, and the distribution statistics in each block are extracted to form the feature. The robustness of the proposed method comes from the fact that the noise is normally more diffuse than the signal and therefore the effect of the noise is limited to a particular quantization region, leaving the other regions less changed. The method is tested on a database of 60 sound classes containing a mixture of collision, action and characteristic sounds and shows a significant improvement over other methods in mismatched conditions, without the need for noise reduction.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2010.2100380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672395","Central moments;nonlinear mapping;sound event classification;spectrogram;support vector machine","Spectrogram;Noise;Feature extraction;Speech;Quantization;Dynamic range;Accuracy","acoustic signal processing;feature extraction;pattern classification","spectrogram image feature;sound event classification;mismatched conditions;visual signature;time-frequency representation;image pseudocoloration;monochrome image;quantization region","","141","","10","IEEE","20 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our proposal is a compact image descriptor that combines the state-of-the-art in content-based descriptor extraction with a multilevel, Voronoi-based spatial partitioning of each dataset image. The proposed multilevel Voronoi-based encoding uses a spatial hierarchical K-means over interest-point locations, and computes a content-based descriptor over each cell. In order to reduce the matching complexity with minimal or no sacrifice in retrieval performance: 1) we utilize the tree structure of the spatial hierarchical K-means to perform top-to-bottom pruning for local similarity maxima; 2) we propose a new image similarity score that combines relevant information from all partition levels into a single measure for similarity; 3) we combine our proposal with a novel and efficient approach for optimal bit allocation within quantized descriptor representations. By deriving both a Voronoi-based VLAD descriptor (called Fast-VVLAD) and a Voronoi-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) descriptor (called Fast-VDCNN), we demonstrate that our Voronoi-based framework is agnostic to the descriptor basis, and can easily be slotted into existing frameworks. Via a range of ROI queries in two standard datasets, it is shown that the Voronoi-based descriptors achieve comparable or higher mean average precision against conventional grid-based spatial search, while offering more than twofold reduction in complexity.

The digital CIM macro is designed for processing neural networks with reconfigurable 1-16 bit input and weight precisions based on bit-serial computing architecture and a novel all-digital bitcell structure. A column of bitcells forms a column MAC and used for computing a multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation. The column MACs placed in a row work as a single neuron and computes a dot-product, which is an essential building block of neural network accelerators. Several key features differentiate the proposed Colonnade architecture from the existing analog and digital implementations. First, its full-digital circuit implementation is free from process variation, noise susceptibility, and data-conversion overhead that are prevalent in prior analog CIM macros. A bitwise MAC operation in a bitcell is performed in the digital domain using a custom-designed XNOR gate and a full-adder. Second, the proposed CIM macro is fully reconfigurable in both weight and input precision from 1 to 16 bit. So far, most of the analog macros were used for processing quantized neural networks with very low input/weight precisions, mainly due to a memory density issue. Recent digital accelerators have implemented reconfigurable precisions, but they are inferior in energy efficiency due to significant off-chip memory access. We present a regular digital bitcell array that is readily reconfigured to a 1-16 bit weight-stationary bit-serial CIM macro. The macro computes parallel dot-product operations between the weights stored in memory and inputs that are serialized from LSB to MSB. Finally, the bit-serial computing scheme significantly reduces the area overhead while sacrificing latency due to bit-by-bit operation cycles. Based on the benefits of digital CIM, reconfigurability, and bit-serial computing architecture, the Colonnade can achieve both high performance and energy efficiency (i.e., both benefits of prior analog and digital accelerators) for processing neural networks. A test-chip with 128 ×128 SRAM-based bitcells for digital bit-serial computing is implemented using 65-nm technology and tested with 1-16 bit weight/input precisions.

The quantization errors result in reduced beamforming gain from the transmitter, as well as interference leakage from the helper. First, under the assumption that the eavesdropper's CSI is completely unknown, we derive a lower bound on the average main channel rate and find the feedback bit allocation that maximizes the jamming power under a constraint on the bound. For the case where statistical CSI for the eavesdropper's channel is available, we derive a lower bound on the average secrecy rate, and we optimize the bound to find a suitable bit allocation and the transmit powers allocated to the transmitter and helper. For the case where the transmitter and helper have the same number of antennas, we obtain a closed-form solution for the optimal bit allocation.

To observe these effects, we utilize two power amplifier models that have different effects on transmitted signals. The Rapp model considers only amplitude deformation and the resultant in-phase and quadrature errors can be assumed to be independent on the receiver side. Unlike the Rapp model, the Saleh model exerts both amplitude and phase deformations and the phase deformation introduces correlation between the in-phase and quadrature errors according to our observations. In addition to the correlation, the variances of in-phase and quadrature errors may not be equal to each other. In this paper, we propose receivers that consider error variances of each quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbol. We compare the performances of the receivers with those of other receivers that take average error variances into account for decoding.

Its contribution is twofold. First, the achievable rate-region with imperfect CSI at the transmitters due to channel quantization errors is analyzed for the two-user case. An analytically tractable inner bound on that region is derived, which provides insights into the problem. Similarly to the case of perfect CSI at the transmitters, it can be shown that beamforming constitutes an optimal strategy for achieving the boundary points of the inner bound. Second, we present a novel CSI feedback scheme that reduces the cross-link CSI feedback overhead, and enhances throughput for any rate-limited feedback scheme. This feedback reduction is crucial when control channels for sharing information between transmitters and unintended receivers are rate limited. A distinguishing feature of the proposed scheme is that feedback is taken into account already at the channel estimation stage. While maintaining a high array gain in the direct channel towards the intended user, the scheme induces an effective low-dimensional cross-link channel, which can be quantized more accurately than the full-dimensional channel. This eventually leads to enhanced performance while maintaining a low CSI feedback overhead. Finally, the proposed feedback scheme is extended to the case of N>2 users and shown to provide a significant reduction in CSI feedback overhead in a practically oriented setting.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2019.2905820","Heron Consortium; Israel Innovation Authority; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668464","Multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel;channel estimation;single-user decoding;imperfect channel state information (CSI);random vector quantization;spatial diversity;interference mitigation","Transmitters;Quantization (signal);Receivers;MISO communication;Interference channels;Array signal processing;Channel estimation","array signal processing;channel estimation;decoding;MISO communication;quantisation (signal);radio transmitters;radiofrequency interference;Rayleigh channels;wireless channels","two-user MISO interference channel;single-user decoding;channel dimension reduction;Rayleigh fading multiple-input single-output interference channel;quantization errors;CSI feedback scheme;low-dimensional cross-link channel;full-dimensional channel;low CSI feedback overhead;channel state information feedback;channel estimation","","4","","49","IEEE","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reducing the rates even further is a challenge in particular for coders using waveform-based coding paradigms. Specifically for transform-based coders it is often the case that transform coefficients are quantized at less than 1 bit/coefficient (on average) in many areas of the spectrum. Dealing with such cases is particularly challenging when some coefficients are assumed to be independent identically distributed random variables with little underlying predictable structure. This prompts a study on how to improve encoding in such situations beyond simply increasing the dimension of quantizers, an option that may not be practical or perceptually relevant in some coder designs. This paper looks at a general class of schemes motivated by observations on statistical variations at low dimensions. These schemes, termed partial ordering schemes, show advantages objectively (in mean square error) and perceptually by targeting randomly positioned peaks in the spectrum. At low rates, such schemes create sparse bit allocations that allow for further optimization using random noise fill.

In the preliminary work, we have proposed to learn binary codes for information networks, but graph analytics may suffer from large accuracy degradation. To reduce information loss while achieving memory and search efficiency, we further propose to learn quantized codes for information networks. In particular, each node is represented by compositing multiple latent vectors, each of which is optimally selected from a distinct set.

The objective is to provide efficient LSF quantization for a speech coder with very large delay but very- to ultra-low bit-rate and good quality. To do this, a long-term model of the time-trajectory of the LSF vectors is applied on long segments of speech to capture the inter-frame correlation of the vectors over each whole segment. Using this model, it is shown that only a reduced set of LSF vectors need to be quantized to derive quantized LSF vectors at every original location.

For this purpose, the quantized values of the sparse frames are pre-adjusted in a controlled manner with distortion in mind (hence the name “targeted dithering”). The decoder then progresses through the possible combinations of the nonzero elements, and verifies with the filler vector which of these combinations produces an integer valued f, thereby retrieving the active elements' positions.

Bennett used a companding model for nonuniform quantization and proposed the formulaD \: = \: \frac{1}{12N^{2}} \: \int \: p(x) [ É(x) ]^{-2} \dxfor the mean-square quantizing error whereNis the number of levels,p(x) is the probability density of the input, andE \prime(x) is the slope of the compressor curve. The formula, an approximation based on the assumption that the number of levels is large and overload distortion is negligible, is a useful tool for analytical studies of quantization. This paper gives a heuristic argument generalizing Bennett's formula to block quantization where a vector of random variables is quantized. The approach is again based on the asymptotic situation whereN, the number of quantized output vectors, is very large. Using the resulting heuristic formula, an optimization is performed leading to an expression for the minimum quantizing noise attainable for any block quantizer of a given block sizek. The results are consistent with Zador's results and specialize to known results for the one- and two-dimensional cases and for the case of infinite block length(k \rightarrow \infty). The same heuristic approach also gives an alternate derivation of a bound of Elias for multidimensional quantization. Our approach leads to a rigorous method for obtaining upper bounds on the minimum distortion for block quantizers. In particular, fork = 3we give a tight upper bound that may in fact be exact. The idea of representing a block quantizer by a block ""compressor"" mapping followed with an optimal quantizer for uniformly distributed random vectors is also explored. It is not always possible to represent an optimal quantizer with this block companding model.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.1979.1056067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1056067","","","","Quantization (signal);Signal quantization","","663","7","17","","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A high transcoding ratio may result in an unacceptable picture quality when the full frame rate of the incoming video bitstream is used. Frame skipping is often used as an efficient scheme to allocate more bits to the representative frames, so that an acceptable quality for each frame can be maintained. However, the skipped frame must be decompressed completely, which might act as a reference frame to nonskipped frames for reconstruction. The newly quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of the prediction errors need to be re-computed for the nonskipped frame with reference to the previous nonskipped frame; this can create undesirable complexity as well as introduce re-encoding errors. In this paper, we propose new algorithms and a novel architecture for frame-rate reduction to improve picture quality and to reduce complexity. The proposed architecture is mainly performed on the DCT domain to achieve a transcoder with low complexity. With the direct addition of DCT coefficients and an error compensation feedback loop, re-encoding errors are reduced significantly. Furthermore, we propose a frame-rate control scheme which can dynamically adjust the number of skipped frames according to the incoming motion vectors and re-encoding errors due to transcoding such that the decoded sequence can have a smooth motion as well as better transcoded pictures. Experimental results show that, as compared to the conventional transcoder, the new architecture for frame-skipping transcoder is more robust, produces fewer requantization errors, and has reduced computational complexity.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2002.800890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025163","","Discrete cosine transforms;Transcoding;Video compression;Bit rate;Error compensation;Feedback loop;Motion control;Error correction;Decoding;Computer architecture","video coding;discrete cosine transforms;transform coding;computational complexity;coding errors;data compression","dynamic frame-skipping transcoder;bitrate;compressed video signal;transcoding ratio;picture quality;frame rate;video bitstream;reconstruction;discrete cosine transform coefficients;DCT coefficients;prediction errors;nonskipped frame;complexity;re-encoding errors;error compensation feedback loop;frame-rate control scheme;incoming motion vectors;requantization errors;computational complexity","","70","9","27","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in general, this result requires to precode the data bearing signals over a signal space of asymptotically large diversity, e.g., over an infinite number of dimensions for time-frequency varying fading channels, or over an infinite number of rationally independent signal levels, in the case of time-frequency invariant channels. In this paper, we consider a wireless cellular system scenario where the promised optimal DoFs are achieved with linear precoding in one-shot (i.e., over a single time-frequency slot). We focus on the uplink of a symmetric cellular system, where each cell is split into three sectors with orthogonal intrasector multiple access. In our model, interference is local, i.e., it is due to transmitters in neighboring cells only. We consider a noniterative local cooperation scheme where base stations pass to their neighbors their decoded messages such that interference from already decoded messages can be canceled. Therefore, for a given decoding order, the interference between sectors is described by a directed locally connected graph. The problem consists of maximizing the per-sector DoFs over all possible decoding orders and precoding schemes. In particular, we provide a decoding order and a one-shot interference alignment scheme able to achieve optimal per-sector DoFs, up to an additive gap due to boundary effects, that vanishes as the size of the network becomes large. Then, we extend our treatment by considering the case of intersector interference with joint processing of the three sector at each cell site. In order to avoid signaling schemes relying on the strength of interference, we further introduce the notion of topologically robust schemes, which are able to guarantee a minimum rate (or DoFs) irrespectively of the strength of the interfering links. Toward this end, we design a different decoding order and alignment scheme, which is topologically robust and still achieves the same optimum DoFs. Finally, we provide a new scheme for the downlink, based on local base station cooperation, where base stations pass to their neighbors a quantized version of their dirty-paper coded signals. For the proposed downlink scheme, we can prove a DoFs duality result showing that, for an appropriate choice of the precoding order and of the alignment beamforming vectors, it can achieve the same per-sector DoFs of the corresponding uplink schemes.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2015.2389244","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-CIF 1161801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7003986","Interference Alignment;Cellular Systems;Interference Cancellation;Base Station Cooperation;Interference alignment;cellular systems;interference cancellation;base station cooperation","Interference;Base stations;Decoding;Uplink;Receivers;Downlink;Transmitters","array signal processing;cellular radio;cooperative communication;decoding;fading channels;Gaussian channels;linear codes;mobile antennas;precoding;radio transmitters;radiofrequency interference;receiving antennas;telecommunication signalling;time-varying channels;transmitting antennas","cellular interference alignment;Gaussian interference channels;degree of freedom;DoF;transmit-receive antennas;time-frequency varying fading channels;time-frequency invariant channels;wireless cellular system;linear precoding;time-frequency slot;symmetric cellular system;orthogonal intrasector multiple access;transmitters;noniterative local cooperation scheme;base stations;decoded messages;decoding;one-shot interference alignment scheme;signaling schemes;local base station cooperation;dirty-paper coded signals;downlink scheme;alignment beamforming vectors","","51","","51","IEEE","7 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, the C-BFFs are optimized for two different criteria, namely, maximum average mutual information (AMI) per sub-carrier and minimum average uncoded bit error rate (BER). If the C-BFF length Lg is equal to the number of sub-carriers Nc,closed-form solutions to both optimization problems exist. For the practically relevant case Lg < Nc we present numerical methods for calculation of the optimum C-BFFs for both criteria. Using a global vector quantization (GVQ) approach the C-BFFs are quantized for practical finite-rate feedback channels.

In the receiver, we propose to split the analog combining subsystem into a channel gain aggregation stage followed by a spreading stage. Both stages use phase shifters. Our goal is to design the two-stage analog combiner to optimize mutual information (MI) between the transmitted and quantized signals by effectively managing quantization error. To this end, we formulate an unconstrained MI maximization problem without a constant modulus constraint on analog combiners, and derive a two-stage analog combining solution. The solution achieves the optimal scaling law with respect to the number of radio frequency chains and maximizes the MI for homogeneous singular values of a MIMO channel. We further develop a two-stage analog combining algorithm to implement the derived solution for mmWave channels. By decoupling channel gain aggregation and spreading functions from the derived solution, the proposed algorithm implements the two functions by using array response vectors and a discrete Fourier transform matrix under the constant modulus constraint on each matrix element. Therefore, the proposed algorithm provides a near-optimal solution for the unconstrained problem, whereas conventional hybrid approaches offer a near optimal solution only for a constrained problem. The closed-form approximation of the ergodic rate is derived for the algorithm, showing that a practical digital combiner with two-stage analog combining also achieves the optimal scaling law.

After the detection of the hand, the tracking will take place in further step in order to determine the motion trajectory so-called gesture path. The second stage, feature extraction enhances the gesture path which gives us a pure path and also determines the orientation between the center of gravity and each point in a pure path. Thereby, the orientation is quantized to give a discrete vector that used as input to HMM. In the final stage, the gesture of alphabets is recognized by using Left-Right Banded model (LRB) in conjunction with Baum-Welch algorithm (BW) for training the parameters of HMM. Therefore, the best path is obtained by Viterbi algorithm using a gesture database. In our experiment, 520 trained gestures are used for training and also 260 tested gestures for testing.

The classical Hamiltonian is derived for such a coupled system using Lorenz gauge and decoupled scalar and vector potential formulations. The classical equations of motion are derivable from the Hamiltonian using Hamilton equations. Then the Hamiltonian is quantized with all the pertinent variables with the introduction of commutators between the variables and their conjugate pairs. The quantum equations of motion can be derived using the quantum Hamilton equations. It can be shown that such a quantization scheme preserves the quantum commutators introduced. Then a noise bath consisting of simple harmonic oscillators is introduced and coupled to the matter consisting of Lorentz oscillators to induce quantum loss. Langevin source emerges naturally in such a procedure, and it can be shown that the results are consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and the quantization procedure of Welsch's group. The advantage of the present procedure is that no diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is necessary to arrive at the quantum equations of motion.

When the relevant side information is a subspace, the feedback scheme can be viewed as a lossy source compression scheme on the Grassmannian manifold. Memoryless vector quantization on each fading block is a viable compression scheme, but it neglects any temporal correlation between the blocks. In this paper, we propose an incremental approach to Grassmannian quantization that takes advantage of temporal correlation. The approach leverages existing codebooks for memoryless quantization schemes and employs a quantized form of geodesic interpolation. Two schemes that implement the principles of the proposed approach are presented. In the first scheme, the choice of the step size in the incremental update is adapted to a first-order GaussMarkov model for the channel, which enables the use of higher resolution codebooks. In the second scheme, a single bit is allocated to the step size, which enables adaptation of the step size to the channel realization rather than the channel statistics. This provides substantial robustness against mismatches in the model for the temporal correlation. A distinguishing feature of the proposed approach is that the direction of the geodesic interpolation is specified implicitly using a point in a conventional codebook. As a result, the approach has an inherent ability to recover autonomously from errors in the feedback path. Simulation results demonstrate that these features result in improved performance over some existing schemes in a variety of channel environments.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2014.2388437","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001680","Channel temporal correlation;downlink;geodesic;limited feedback","Transmitters;Correlation;Quantization (signal);Receivers;MIMO;Manifolds;Fading","fading channels;Gaussian distribution;interpolation;Markov processes;MIMO communication;multiuser channels;quantisation (signal);radio transmitters","multiuser MIMO systems;incremental Grassmannian feedback schemes;transmitter adaptation;fading channels;lossy source compression scheme;vector quantization;viable compression scheme;Grassmannian quantization;geodesic interpolation;first-order GaussMarkov model;resolution codebooks;feedback path;temporal correlation;channel realization","","7","","42","IEEE","6 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the sparse sources are quantized and compressed using syndrome-based encoders. The theoretical performance of the schemes is provided, accounting for the uncertainty in the support estimation. In particular, we derive the operational distortion-rate and operational distortion-energy of the encoders for noisy Bernoulli-uniform and Bernoulli-Gaussian sparse sources. It is found that the performance of the proposed encoders approaches the information-theoretic bounds for sources with low sparsity order.

The codec is especially well suited for communications applications because it is based on motion-compensated predictive coding which provides the necessary low-delay property. The frames to be coded are decomposed into a Gaussian pyramid. Motion estimation and compensation are performed between corresponding pyramid levels of successive frames. We show that, to fulfill specific needs of spatial scalability, the motion compensation on each level must result in compatible prediction errors (displaced frame differences, DFD). Compatibility of the prediction errors means that the pyramid formed by independently obtained DFD's (the DFD pyramid) is close to a Gaussian pyramid decomposition of the DFD of the highest resolution level. From the DFD pyramid, a least squares Laplacian pyramid is derived, which is quantized and coded. The DFD encoder outputs an embedded bit stream. Thus, the coder control may truncate the bit stream at any point, and can keep a fixed rate. The motion vector fields obtained at the different resolution levels are also encoded by employing a pyramid approach. Simulation results show that the proposed coder achieves a coding gain compared to simulcast coding.","1558-0008","","10.1109/49.650043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=650043","","Video compression;Spatial resolution;Design for disassembly;Video coding;Bit rate;Codecs;Predictive coding;Motion estimation;Scalability;Motion compensation","data compression;video coding;motion compensation;motion estimation;image resolution;coding errors;video codecs;Gaussian processes;least squares approximations;prediction theory","spatially scalable video compression;resolution pyramids;video coding;low bit rates;codec;communications applications;motion-compensated predictive coding;low-delay;least squares Laplacian pyramid;motion estimation;prediction errors;displaced frame differences;Gaussian pyramid decomposition;quantization;embedded bit stream;encoder;motion vector fields;simulation results;coding gain;simulcast coding","","6","6","21","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we focus on a setting where this problem is especially acute: compressive sensing frameworks for interferometry and medical imaging. We ask the following question: can the precision of the data representation be lowered for all inputs, with recovery guarantees and practical performance? Our first contribution is a theoretical analysis of the normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm when all input data, meaning both the measurement matrix and the observation vector are quantized aggressively. We present a variant of low precision normalized IHT that, under mild conditions, can still provide recovery guarantees. The second contribution is the application of our quantization framework to radio astronomy and magnetic resonance imaging. We show that lowering the precision of the data can significantly accelerate image recovery.

The distortion metric is the average loss in capacity (forward rate) relative to the capacity with perfect channel state information at the transmitter and receiver. The corresponding rate distortion function gives the forward capacity as a function of feedback rate, and is determined explicitly by casting the minimization of mutual information in the rate-distortion problem as an optimal control problem.

The design of a feedback scheme to implement this strategy can be viewed as a (lossy) source compression problem on a Grassmannian manifold. Memoryless vector quantization on each fading block is one approach to that problem, but it neglects any correlation between blocks. In some recent work, several approaches have been proposed to take advantage of this correlation. In this paper we propose an alternative technique that leverages existing Grassmannian codebooks from memoryless schemes and employs a quantized form of geodesic interpolation. Distinguishing features of the proposed technique include the fact that it only requires a single codebook, and the fact that it enables the step length of the geodesic interpolation to be adapted to the channel realization, rather than the channel statistics.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks have been widely used for natural language processing, time series prediction and many other sequential data tasks. Thus, for these applications there is increasing need for low-power accelerators for LSTM model inference at the edge. In order to reduce power dissipation due to data transfers within inference devices, there has been significant interest in accelerating vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) operations using non-volatile memory (NVM) weight arrays. In NVM array-based hardware, reduced bit-widths also significantly increases the power efficiency. In this paper, we focus on the application of quantization-aware training algorithm to LSTM models, and the benefits these models bring in terms of resilience against both quantization error and analog device noise. We have shown that only 4-bit NVM weights and 4-bit ADC/DACs are needed to produce equivalent LSTM network performance as floating-point baseline. Reasonable levels of ADC quantization noise and weight noise can be naturally tolerated within our NVM-based quantized LSTM network. Benchmark analysis of our proposed LSTM accelerator for inference has shown at least 2.4× better computing efficiency and 40× higher area efficiency than traditional digital approaches (GPU, FPGA, and ASIC). Some other novel approaches based on NVM promise to deliver higher computing efficiency (up to ×4.7) but require larger arrays with potential higher error rates.","","978-1-7281-5221-9","10.1109/ICRC.2019.8914713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8914713","quantization;noise;LSTM;non-volatile memory;machine learning hardware","Nonvolatile memory;Hardware;Acceleration;Quantization (signal);Logic gates;Virtual machine monitors;Training","analogue-digital conversion;digital-analogue conversion;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix multiplication;neural nets;random-access storage;time series","nonvolatile memory array;noise-resilient LSTM neural networks;short-term memory;natural language processing;time series prediction;low-power accelerators;LSTM model inference;power dissipation;vector-matrix multiplication;nonvolatile memory weight arrays;NVM array-based hardware;quantization-aware training;LSTM models;quantization error;analog device noise;equivalent LSTM network performance;LSTM accelerator;NVM weights;quantization-resilient LSTM neural networks;quantization-aware training algorithm;ADC-DAC;floating-point baseline;ADC quantization noise","","1","","38","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Systems operating in moderate to high SNR regimes experience a pronounced capacity loss and also impairments in the quality of the channel estimates, compared to the infinite precision case. This work proposes a multiuser MIMO channel estimation algorithm that operates with low-resolution receiving ADCs. The strategy is based on an coarse quantizer followed by an EM-ML estimator, that takes as input the observation vector subtracted by an offset value produced by a first rough channel estimate. The approach performed by this feedback-controlled double-stage estimator aims to make the quantizer thresholds based on the low-SNR Cramér-Rao lower bound approximation valid in the high SNR region. Numerical analysis reveals that reliable estimation is achieved in coarse quantization for a wide range of SNR with a very small and constant gap in relation to infinite precision quantized estimation.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-8131-1","10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8683652","Quantization;MIMO;multiuser;channel estimation;EM algorithm;Cramér-Rao Lower Bound","","analogue-digital conversion;approximation theory;channel estimation;expectation-maximisation algorithm;feedback;maximum likelihood estimation;MIMO communication;multiuser channels;quantisation (signal)","coarse quantizer;EM-ML estimator;rough channel estimate;coarse quantization;feedback-controlled channel estimation;quantization operation;multiuser MIMO channel estimation algorithm;low-resolution ADC;multiuser MIMO systems;observation vector;low-SNR Cramer-Rao lower bound approximation","","1","","12","","17 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combining this information appropriately using the backhaul is known to yield high gains, especially when the interference avoidance is used across the EnodeBs in CoMP. We consider a load-balanced, dense, small-cell deployment where a UE may be connected not to the strongest EnodeB in order to ensure nearly equal loading across different small cells. In such situations, the benefit of uplink co-operation between the EnodeBs will be very significant since some of the co-operating EnodeBs may have a more stronger signal copy from the UE, than the desired EnodeB. Further, we consider the universal-reuse between the small cells so that the spectrum utilization is maximized (i.e.no interference avoidance), and non-linear (joint) detectors are used at the EnodeBs to handle the strong interferences. We propose a novel joint log- likelihood ratio (LLR) computation, vector quantization and combining approach for such a very strong interference regime. Not only does this quantized sharing approach reduce the bit rate required on the backhaul between the different EnodeBs, but also provides a performance within 0.3dB of the unquantized LLR sharing performance with only 1.2 to 2.4 bits per LLR.","","978-1-5090-1328-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841941","","Quantization (signal);Uplink;Interference;Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Diversity reception;Modulation","cellular radio;interference suppression;Long Term Evolution;resource allocation","load-balanced small cells;uplink coordinated multipoint;Uplink CoMP;LTE;multiple base-stations;EnodeB;spectrum utilization;joint log- likelihood ratio computation;vector quantization and combining approach","","","","11","","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing CS-based methods usually obtain the estimation result through one-stage channel sounding that have two limitations: (i) the requirement of large-dimensional dictionary and (ii) unresolvable quantization error. These two drawbacks are irreconcilable; improvement of the one implies deterioration of the other. To address these challenges, we propose, in this paper, a two-stage method to estimate the AoAs and AoDs of mmWave channels. In the proposed method, the channel estimation task is divided into two stages, Stage I and Stage II. Specifically, in Stage I, the AoAs are estimated by solving a multiple measurement vectors (MMV) problem. In Stage II, based on the estimated AoAs, the receive sounders are designed to estimate AoDs. The dimension of the angle dictionary in each stage can be reduced, which in turn reduces the computational complexity substantially. We then analyze the successful recovery probability (SRP) of the proposed method, revealing the superiority of the proposed framework over the existing one-stage CS-based methods. We further enhance the reconstruction performance by performing resource allocation between the two stages. We also overcome the unresolvable quantization error issue present in the prior techniques by applying the atomic norm minimization method to each stage of the proposed two-stage approach. The simulation results illustrate the substantially improved performance with low complexity of the proposed two-stage method.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2022.3168886","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:CNS1955561); Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:N00014-21-1-2472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9760446","Millimeter wave communications;compressed sensing;channel estimation;multiple-input multiple-output system;support recovery;sequential estimation","Channel estimation;Estimation;Dictionaries;Receivers;Transmitters;Matching pursuit algorithms;Sensors","channel estimation;compressed sensing;computational complexity;direction-of-arrival estimation;matrix algebra;millimetre wave communication;MIMO communication;minimisation;probability;quantisation (signal);resource allocation;signal reconstruction;wireless channels","one-stage channel sounding;large-dimensional dictionary;AoD;channel estimation;multiple measurement vectors problem;atomic norm minimization method;mmWave MIMO channel;angles of arrivals;angle dictionary matrices;AoA;compressed sensing-based mmWave channel estimation methods;millimeter-wave multiple-input multiple-output channel;unresolvable quantization error;one-stage compressed sensing-based methods;MMV problem;angles of departures;successful recovery probability;resource allocation","","","","49","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To detect the current phase at a given time point of an operation, some sets of training data with correct phase labels need to be learned by LDA. All documents which are actually short clips divided from the recorded videos are presented as mixtures over learned latent topics. These presentations are then quantized as observed values of a HMM.

Compared to previous work, the main novelty lies in the use of improved quantization to represent the (transformed) prediction error of LSF parameters. Generalized Gaussian modeling is applied for this purpose. We review existing methods to fit the free model parameter of a generalized Gaussian model to real data and show that that the distribution of the prediction error for LSF parameters is indeed very close to Laplacian.

In speech synthesis, the LP is also used to generate the glottal or residual excitation for the WaveNet. We have proposed a Time-Varying Complex AR (TV-CAR) speech analysis for an analytic signal to cope with the drawbacks of the LP, such as MMSE, Extended Least Square (ELS), that are the l2-norm optimization methods. We have already evaluated the performance on F0 estimation and robust automatic speech recognition. Recently, we have proposed l2-norm regularized LP-based TV-CAR analysis in the time-domain and the frequency-domain. The regularized TV-CAR method can estimate more accurate formant frequencies, and we have shown that the resulting LP residual makes it possible to estimate a more precise F0. On the other hand, sparse estimation based on l1-norm optimization has been focused on image processing that can extract meaningful information from colossal information. LASSO algorithm is an l1-norm regularized sparse algorithm.

We show that an arbitrary signal in ℝk can be recovered from its quantized frame coefficients up to an error which decays root-exponentially in the oversampling rate m/k. Here the quantization scheme is assumed to be chosen appropriately depending on the oversampling rate and the quantization alphabet can be coarse. The result holds with high probability on the draw of the frame uniformly for all signals. The crux of the argument is a bound on the extreme singular values of the product of a deterministic matrix and a sub-Gaussian frame. For fine quantization alphabets, we leverage this bound to show polynomial error decay in the context of compressed sensing.

To design such a system, the global channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) as well as at the receiver is necessary. But in practice, it is hard to obtain this information, therefore, limited feedback is used to provide CSIT or the precoder design information to the transmitter. Conventionally, precoders are quantized at receiver by finding its best match in the codebook using chordal distance and its index is fedback to the transmitter. In this paper, instead of minimizing chordal distance, we propose algorithms with objectives that are derived from subspace alignment method, SINR maximization, or minimization of leakage interference power to measure the “goodness” of quantized vector.

For extracting DCTC, speech samples are transformed into DCT coefficients first and IDCT is performed on logarithm of DCT coefficients. These features are captured and quantized into M clusters representing L feature vectors by means of K-means clustering approach. Twins identification is done on the basis of finding distance between cluster centroids and feature vectors of the noisy test speech.

Especially interesting is the case, when extreme quantization is enforced that captures only the sign of the measurements. The problem becomes even more difficult if the measurements are corrupted by noise. In this paper we consider additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). To solve this problem, we employ the highly efficient generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm and provide closed-form expressions for the nonlinear steps.

Meanwhile, secure aggregation enables the server to learn an aggregate of at least a threshold number of device's model contributions without observing any individual device's contribution in unaggregated form. In this paper, we highlight some of the challenges of setting the parameters for secure aggregation to achieve communication efficiency, especially in the context of the aggressively quantized inputs enabled by random rotation. We then develop a recipe for auto-tuning communication-efficient secure aggregation, based on specific properties of random rotation and secure aggregation - namely, the predictable distribution of vector entries post-rotation and the modular wrapping inherent in secure aggregation.

The sign bit can be interpreted as the most significant bit (MSB) in the binary representation of the syntax element. Our work is motivated by the key observation that the binary code used for this representation has an impact on the quality of the reconstruction at the eavesdropper and on the size of the stream to be encrypted. Therefore, we address the problem of optimal binary code design for partial encryption. Ideally, the goal is to simultaneously maximize the eavesdropper's distortion and minimize the length of the compressed MSB stream. Since these two objectives are conflicting in general, we formulate the problem as the maximization of a weighted sum of the eavesdropper's distortion and of the probability of the MSB being 0. We cast the problem as a binary integer linear program equivalent to a maximum weight matching problem, which has a polynomial-time solution algorithm. We show that when the source to be quantized and the quantizer are symmetric, the problem can be converted to a linear program of a smaller size, for a family of distortion metrics. Extensive experiments assess the performance of the optimized binary code in comparison with existing approaches. The results reveal that certain existing partial encryption schemes could benefit from the proposed design.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2020.3015500","NSERC Discovery Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165003","Partial/selective encryption;binary code;maximum weight matching;linear programming","Encryption;Binary codes;Image coding;Videos;Distortion;Syntactics","binary codes;cryptography;data compression;integer programming;linear programming;probability;video coding","compressed MSB stream;eavesdropper distortion;binary integer linear program;maximum weight matching problem;optimized binary code;partial encryption schemes;compressed images;binary representation;optimal binary code design;polynomial-time solution algorithm","","","","34","IEEE","11 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, system states are coupled with observations, and the quantization parts are unknown inherent components, which hinder the design of inputs and quantizers. In order to deal with the temporal dependency of observations and achieve the recursive estimation of network weights, a deterministic objective function is constructed based on the likelihood function by extending the dimension of observations and applying ergodic properties of Markov chains. By imposing an independent Gaussian assumption on disturbances, we show that the function is strictly concave and has a unique maximum identical to the true parameter vector, so in this way the estimation problem is transformed to an optimization problem. A recursive algorithm based on stochastic approximation techniques is proposed to solve this problem, and the strong consistency of the algorithm is established.

"Layered Motion Compensation for Moving Image Compression","G. Demos",NA,"SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal","19 Oct 2015","2009","118","1","27","33","Block-based motion compensation began with MPEG-1 and H.261 and has continued into MPEG-2, MPEG-4_part 2, MPEG-4_AVC_part 10, H.264, and SMPTE VC1. The general principle used by these conventional motion compensation systems is that there is one motion vector for a square or rectangular group of pixels. The group of pixels associated with the motion vector is generally referred as a “macroblock.” It is common in MPEG and other compression systems to use reduced resolution for Red-Y (U) and Blue-Y (V) compared to Y (luminance), where Y usually equals approximately .59Green + .29Red + .12Blue. Intra-coded frames and the motion-compensated-difference frames use a common quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT). The macroblock structure provides a common boundary for the Y, U, and V DCT-coded regions. The DCT size is usually 8 × 8 pixels, but may be anywhere from 4 × 4 up to 16 × 16 (e.g., in MPEG-4 AVC_part 10 and H.264). The nature of the DCT is that it is a self-contained regional transform that does not extend to any pixel outside its block (usually 8 × 8). In a sense, quantization errors in the DCT wrap from one edge to the other (i.e., left to right, and top to bottom) of the DCT block. Differing quantization errors in adjacent DCT blocks yield block edge discontinuities. Thus, because macroblock boundaries coincide with DCT block boundaries, they share a common edge. When a motion vector differs between adjacent macroblocks, the inherent edge discontinuity does not appear within the DCT block, but rather at its edge. The DCT block edge “wraps around” to see its opposite edges, so the DCT is quite tolerant of the edges inherent in macroblock-based motion compensation.","2160-2492","","10.5594/J14988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7270601","","","","","","7","","2","","19 Oct 2015","","","SMPTE","SMPTE Journals"

We present a method for designing an efficient low-rate quantizer for the dominant right singular vectors of a MIMO channel matrix, which exploits the memory in the slow-varying channel fading process. A memory-based (recursive) quantizer is considered which quantizes the time-trajectory of points representing the channel subs-spaces on a Grassmannian manifold.

With conventional transform coding, based on computing Karhunen-Loeve transform coefficients and then quantizing them, vector entropy coding can be replaced by scalar entropy coding without an increase in rate. Thus the transform coding advantage is a reduction in memory requirements for entropy coding. This paper develops a transform coding technique where the source samples are first scalar-quantized and then transformed with an integer-to-integer approximation to a nonorthogonal linear transform. Among the possible advantages is to reduce the memory requirement further than conventional transform coding by using a single common scalar entropy codebook for all components. The analysis shows that for high-rate coding of a Gaussian source, this reduction in memory requirements comes without any degradation of rate-distortion performance.","1557-9654","","10.1109/18.825809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825809","","Transform coding","transform coding;rate distortion theory;entropy codes;Gaussian processes","integer-to-integer transforms;transform coding;entropy coding;memory requirements;nonorthogonal linear transform;scalar entropy codebook;high-rate coding;Gaussian source;rate-distortion performance","","22","12","12","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In many applications in speech coding and image digitization, we are given sets of random variables and we have to quantize them in some way so as to represent their realizations with as few discretized levels (bits) as possible. This has to be done while also minimizing the total quantization error. The quantization level or bit allocation process should therefore be the result of a compromise between the total discretization error and the number of bits used to represent the realizations of random vectors. This paper presents a solution of this problem, extending the classical bit allocation methods in which a fixed, prescribed number of bits have to be allocated to minimize the quantization error. The general soft bit allocation process is useful in designing variable rate (adaptive) coders as opposed to the classical bit allocation procedures that were devised for information transmission over communication channels requiring constant rate encoding.","0096-3518","","10.1109/TASSP.1987.1165184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1165184","","Bit rate;Quantization;Random variables;Speech coding;Channel capacity;Cost function;Communication channels;Rate-distortion","","","","8","1","14","","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Opportunistic routing (OR) aims at improving the former and coping with the latter. Due to the unreliable characteristics of such channels, traditional routing achieves poor throughput. Since traditional routing arbitrarily selects high lossy links among diverse paths of same minimum length. This paper focuses on designing a multipath, multichannel opportunistic ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing protocol that uses shortest distance as well as expected transmissions count (ETX) as a parameter to choose the next forwarding node and the most reliable link respectively. The conventional AODV uses hop count for the selection of route in the network. In this paper it is proposed to harvest the advantage of OR with AODV for cognitive radio wireless sensor networks (CRWSN) to improve its efficiency. The ETX is computed based on the quantized value of RSSI of the links. Using ETX the reliable link is computed and stored in routing table. The packets are forwarded to the destination using the next hop and channel details available in the routing table. The routing parameters such as capacity, spectrum occupancy, throughput, and packet delivery ratio (PDR) are evaluated. Simulation result shows that opportunistic AODV protocol yields increased PDR (7%) than traditional AODV in the presence of two interferers.","","978-1-5090-0396-9","10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7754168","multipath;multichannel;ETX;opportunity;CRWSN;PDR","Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput;Ad hoc networks;Cognitive radio;Wireless sensor networks","cognitive radio;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","opportunistic AODV routing protocol;cognitive radio wireless sensor networks;wireless communication system;wireless channels;expected transmissions count;CRWSN;ETX;OR","","4","","10","","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We model the sensor network from an information theoretical perspective, and propose a novel formulation for distributive source coding to characterize the tradeoff among source coding rates. The new formulation is capable of dealing with the case where the physical source is described by a vector of random variables. We further optimize the power allocation strategy among sensors.

A polynomial is fitted to the set of normalized frequency deviations and the polynomial coefficients are vector quantized in closed-loop. For the transient speech, the voiced part is modeled by the low-frequency harmonic components while the unvoiced part is modeled by an all-pole model. The transitional behavior is represented by the onset time and growth rate of each harmonic component. An analysis-by-synthesis procedure is proposed to determine the onset times and growth rates of the harmonic components in the time domain.

Diversified quantization schemes lead to diverse quantized bit-width and formats of the weights, thereby, subject to different hardware implementations. Such variety prevents a general NPU to leverage different quantization schemes to gain performance and energy-efficiency. More importantly, a trend of quantization diversity emerges that applys multiple quantization schemes to different fine-grained structures (e.g., a layer or a channel of weight) of a DNN. Therefore, a general architecture is desired to exploit varied quantization schemes. Crossbar-based Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architecture, a promising DNN accelerator, is well known for its highly efficient matrix-vector multiplication. However, PIM suffers from the inflexible intra-crossbar data path because the weight is stationary on the crossbar and bind to the “add” operation along the bit-line. Therefore, many non-uniform quantization methods must rollback the quantization before mapping the weights onto the crossbar. Counter-intuitively, this paper discovers a unique opportunity of the PIM architecture to exploit varied quantization schemes. We first transform the quantization diversity problem into a consistency problem by aligning the bit with same magnitude along the same bit-line of the crossbar. Consequently, such naive weight mapping causes many square hollows of idle PIM cells. We then propose a novel spatial mapping to exempt these “hollow” crossbar from the inter-crossbar data path. To further squeeze the weights on fewer crossbars, we decouple the intra-crossbar data path from the hardware bitline by a novel temporal scheduling, so that bits with different magnitudes can be placed on cells along the same bitline. Finally, the proposed IVQ includes a temporal pipeline to avoid the introduced stalling cycles, and a data flow with delicate control mechanisms for the new intra-and inter-crossbar data paths. Putting all together, IVQ achieves 19.7×, 10.7×, 4.7×∼63.4×, 91.7× speedup, and 17.7×, 5.1×, 5.7×∼68.1×, 541× energy savings over two PIM accelerators (ISAAC and CASCADE), two customized quantization accelerators (based on ASIC and FPGA), and NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU, respectively.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2022.3156017","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61834006); National Key Reserch and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1403400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9724255","Process-in-memory;Quantization;Neural Networks;Accelerator;General-purpose.","Quantization (signal);Computer architecture;Hardware;Pipelines;Engines;Computational modeling;Graphics processing units","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

When we merge these multiple clusters into two large preliminary clusters to provide a binary classification, an accuracy of $\sim 87{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ is reached using an imbalanced data set, matching real galaxy distributions, which includes 22.7 per cent early-type galaxies and 77.3 per cent late-type galaxies. Comparing the given clusters with classic Hubble types (ellipticals, lenticulars, early spirals, late spirals, and irregulars), we show that there is an intrinsic vagueness in visual classification systems, in particular galaxies with transitional features such as lenticulars and early spirals. Based on this, the main result in this work is not how well our unsupervised method matches visual classifications and physical properties, but that the method provides an independent classification that may be more physically meaningful than any visually based ones.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stab734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9491341","techniques: image processing;galaxies: general;methods: data analysis","","","","","","","","","20 Jul 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We consider frequency division duplex systems which employ multiple antennas in the downlink only at the transmitter, and in the uplink only at the receiver. In the downlink, the transmitter applies coherent beamforming based on quantized channel information which is obtained by feedback from the receiver. As feedback takes away resources from the uplink - which could otherwise be used to transfer payload data - it is highly desirable to reserve the »right« amount of uplink resources for the feedback. Under the assumption of random vector quantization, and a frequency flat, independent and identically distributed block-fading channel, we derive closed-form expressions for both the feedback quantization and bandwidth partitioning which jointly maximize the sum of the average payload data rates of the downlink and the uplink. While we do introduce some approximations to facilitate mathematical tractability, the analytical solution is asymptotically exact as the number of antennas approaches infinity, while for systems with few antennas, it turns out to be a fairly accurate approximation. In this way, the obtained results are not only attractive from a theoretical point of view, but are meaningful as well for practical communication systems, where usually only a few antennas are employed.","","978-3-8007-3077-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5755788","","Downlink;Signal to noise ratio;Optimized production technology;Bandwidth;Receiving antennas;Array signal processing","","","","","","","","1 Jun 2011","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

However, it is challenging for crossbar architecture to exploit the sparsity in DNNs. It is inevitably complex and costly to exploit fine-grained sparsity due to the limitation of the tightly-coupled crossbar structure. As a countermeasure, we develop a novel ReRAM-based DNN accelerator, named Sparse-Multiplication-Engine (SME), based on a hardware and software co-design framework. First, we orchestrate the bit-sparse pattern to increase the density of bit-sparsity based on existing quantization methods. Such quantized weights can be nicely generated using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization during the DNN fine-tuning, which can exactly enforce bit patterns in weights. Second, we propose a novel weight mapping mechanism to slice the bits of the weight across crossbars and splice the activation results in peripheral circuits. This mechanism can decouple the tightly-coupled crossbar structure and cumulate the sparsity in the crossbar. Finally, a superior squeeze-out scheme empties the crossbars mapped with highly-sparse non-zeros from the previous two steps. We design the SME architecture and discuss its use for other quantization methods and different ReRAM cell technologies. We further propose a workload grouping algorithm and a pipeline to achieve workload balance among crossbar-rows that concurrently execute multiply-accumulate operations to optimize the system latency. Putting all together, with the optimized model, compared with prior state-of-the-art designs, the SME shrinks the use of crossbars up to 8.7× and 2.1× using ResNet-50 and MobileNet-v2, respectively, and achieve average 3.1× speed up with no or little accuracy loss on ImageNet.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2022.3172907","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61834006,62102257); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1403400); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769275","ReRAM;sparsity;neural network;accelerator.","Quantization (signal);Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Hardware;Virtual machine monitors;Routing;Pipelines","","","","","","","IEEE","5 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The library images need not to be associated with spatial information regarding the viewpoint and orientation of the scene. As a result, these images are cheaper than the database images; in addition, they are readily available. Our proposed descriptor directly mines the image library to discover landmarks (i.e., image patches) that suitably match an input query/database image.

The novelty of this approach is that it couples the phase and magnitude gradients near the correlation peak to determine its coordinates with subsample accuracy in both axial and lateral directions. This is achieved with a minimum level of lateral interpolation determined from the angles between the magnitude and phase gradient vectors on the sampled (laterally interpolated) 2-D cross-correlation grid. The key result behind this algorithm is that the magnitude gradient vectors' final approach to the true peak is orthogonal to the zero-phase contour. This leads to a 2-D robust projection on the zero-phase contour that results in subsample accuracy at interpolation levels well below those needed using previously proposed methods. A full description of the 2-D, phase-coupled approach is given, including two implementations based on a geometric projection and constrained optimization.

The novelty is that the residual error array due to quantization is iteratively fedback and requantized (scalar or vector); the coded residual error information is progressively transmitted and utilized in reconstructing the successive approximations.

The key idea is that when the transmitter sends out its training signal, the receiver repeats, or ldquoechoes,rdquo its received signal back to that transmitter. From this round-trip training signal, together with the usual one-way incoming training signal from the receiver, the transmitter is able to recover its own outgoing channel fading coefficients for all transmit/receive pairs of antenna elements. The two-stage, weighted least squares problem to estimate the incoming and outgoing channel response matrices is solved. The method applies to FDD and TDD channels, and is suitable for wireless networks with relays. A second contribution of this paper is to propose another new training step, called naturally channel-matched beamforming (NCMB). This step actively uses the physical channel to match the transmit and receive beamformers, instead of relying on uncoordinated beamformer estimates at the transmit and receive ends. When we create parallel virtual channels, by spatial precoding with singular modes of the channel matrix, this training step directly matches each pair of right and left singular vectors used to beamform, adjusting the receive vector to optimize the virtual link gain for the pair. Evidence for a ridge in the gain surface over beamformer pairs is given, which would explain the near-ideal gains obtained from the channel-matching step. We also show how to optimize the link gains while constraining these pairs to ensure low interchannel interference (ICI). Simulation results show that the echo-MIMO method for the case of channel-matched maximal ratio transmission/combining (MRT/MRC) approaches the performance of the ideal beamformers based on perfect channel estimates, especially for the case of no fewer transmit antennas than receive antennas. In this case, echo-MIMO outperforms a quantized MRT/MRC codebook feedback method.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2008.925971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4527202","Channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT);multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications;naturally channel-matched beamforming (NCMB);nonreciprocal channel;two-way multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation","Array signal processing;Transmitters;Receiving antennas;MIMO;Transmitting antennas;Fading;Least squares approximation;Wireless networks;Relays;Constraint optimization","adjacent channel interference;antenna arrays;channel estimation;fading channels;least squares approximations;MIMO communication;radio networks;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas","echo-MIMO;two-way channel training method;matched cooperative beamforming;two-way multiple-input multiple-output channel sounding method;channel fading coefficients;weighted least squares problem;channel response matrices;FDD;TDD;wireless networks;parallel virtual channels;spatial precoding;interchannel interference;channel-matched maximal ratio transmission/combining approaches;codebook feedback method","","43","4","53","","23 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the absence of full channel knowledge at the transmitter, the transmit beamforming vector can be quantized at the receiver and sent to the transmitter using a low-rate feedback channel. In the literature, quantization algorithms for the beamforming vector are designed and optimized for a particular channel distribution, commonly the uncorrelated Rayleigh distribution. When the channel is not uncorrelated Rayleigh, however, these quantization strategies result in a degradation of the receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, switched codebook quantization is proposed where the codebook is dynamically chosen based on the channel distribution. The codebook adaptation enables the quantization to exploit the spatial and temporal correlation inherent in the channel. The convergence properties of the codebook selection algorithm are studied assuming a block-stationary model for the channel. In the case of a nonstationary channel, it is shown using simulations that the selected codebook tracks the distribution of the channel resulting in improvements in SNR.

As a promising video representation method, local spatio-temporal (LST) features have received increasing attention from computer vision, machine learning, and robotics communities. However, approaches based on traditional LST features only use color information, which face several challenges, such as illumination changes and dynamic backgrounds. The recent availability of commercial color-depth cameras makes it much cheaper, faster, and easier to acquire depth information, which provides a potential to implement more discriminative and robust LST features. In this paper, we introduce the new 4-D color-depth (CoDe4D) LST feature that incorporates both intensity and depth information acquired from RGB-D cameras. Our feature detector constructs a saliency map through applying independent filters in xyzt dimension to represent texture, shape and pose variations, and selects its local maxima as interest points. Our multichannel orientation histogram descriptor applies a 4-D support region, which is adaptive to linear perspective view changes, on each interest point. Then, image gradients of color-depth patches within the support region are computed and quantized using a spherical coordinate-based method to form a final feature vector. We build a complete activity recognition system by combining our features with bag-of-features representations and support vector machines. To evaluate the performance of our CoDe4D LST features and the complete system, we conduct experiments using four benchmark color-depth human activity data sets, including UTK Action3-D, Berkeley MHAD, ACT42, and MSR daily activity 3-D data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the promising representative power of our CoDe4D features, which obtain the state-of-the-art performance on activity recognition from RGB-D visual data.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2376139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967831","Color-depth feature;3D machine vision;human representation;activity recognition;RGB-D sensor;3-D machine vision;activity recognition;color-depth feature;human representation;RGB-D sensor","Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Image color analysis;Visualization;Detectors;Videos;Cameras","human-robot interaction;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);robot vision;video signal processing;video surveillance","CoDe4D;color-depth local spatio-temporal features;human activity recognition;RGB-D videos;video analysis;video surveillance;human-robot interaction;video representation method;local spatio-temporal features;computer vision;machine learning;robotics communities;4D color-depth LST feature;saliency map;multichannel orientation histogram descriptor;image gradients;spherical coordinate-based method","","31","","50","IEEE","26 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In color halftoning, the application of grayscale error-diffusion methods to the individual colorant planes fails to exploit the HVS response to color noise. Ideally the quantization error must be diffused to frequencies and colors, to which the HVS is least sensitive. Further it is desirable for the color quantization to take place in a perceptual space so that the colorant vector selected as the output color is perceptually closest to the color vector being quantized. This article discusses the design principles of color error diffusion that differentiate it from grayscale error diffusion, focusing on color error diffusion halftoning systems using the red, green, and blue (RGB) space for convenience.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2003.1215231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215231","","Colored noise;Gray-scale;Quantization;Pixel;Frequency;Image converters;Image resolution;Printing;Displays;Feedback","colour displays;image resolution;quantisation (signal);feedback;ink jet printers","color error-diffusion halftoning;continuous-tone image;resolution;display;feedback;quantization noise;human visual system;perceptual space;RGB space","","19","2","24","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, it requires perfect channel state information at the transmitter, which necessitates a great amount of feedback. In this paper, we propose a linear precoding scheme for the V-BLAST architecture with an MMSE-SIC receiver. The whole scheme includes the design of an unquantized precoder and its finite rate feedback. The unquantized precoder, consisting of a beamforming matrix and a power allocation matrix, is designed by maximizing the minimum post-detection SINR of the MMSE-SIC receiver. In addition to the optimal precoder, we give a suboptimal solution which is shown to be asymptotically optimal at low SNR. The advantage of this suboptimal solution is that its extension to finite rate feedback is straightforward. Specifically, beamforming vectors are selected sequentially from a predetermined codebook and the indices are fed back. Besides, elements of the power allocation matrix are scalar quantized and fed back. Theoretical analysis reveals that the unquantized beamforming vectors are uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, leading to a very natural codebook design criterion - the Grassmannian criterion. Moreover, the proposed scheme is flexible enough to allow for a change in the number of data streams without redesigning the codebook. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","1558-2248","","10.1109/T-WC.2008.070803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4712716","V-BLAST, MMSE-SIC, beamforming, power;allocation, finite rate feedback.","Transmitters;Array signal processing;Signal to noise ratio;MIMO;Channel state information;Bit error rate;State feedback;Diversity methods;Receiving antennas","array signal processing;channel coding;feedback;interference suppression;least mean squares methods;linear codes;precoding;quantisation (signal);space-time codes","linear precoding;finite rate feedback design;V-BLAST architecture;transmitter channel state information;MMSE-SIC receiver;minimum mean square error successive interference cancellation;unquantized precoder design;finite rate feedback;beamforming matrix;power allocation matrix;scalar quantization;Grassmannian criterion;Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time architecture","","7","","32","","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The estimated angular resolution of this power based method is limited by the resolution of beams. In this paper, a correlation based adaptive compressed sensing (CB-ACS) method is proposed.

To cope with these challenges, the present paper brings forth a novel rank-regularized maximum likelihood approach that models categorical data as quantized values of analog-amplitude features with low intrinsic dimensionality.

This analogy leads to the introduction of an adaptation of the subspace based DOA estimation techniques to the problem of error and erasure correction in the real field. The adaptation incorporates a whitening operation, which is shown to be equivalent to the projection of the syndrome vector onto the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by the erasure locator vectors.

Furthermore, since the proposed approach is based on preamble-based random access, which is widely adopted for machine-type communication (MTC), it can be easily employed for training models with a large number of devices where MTC is used for their connectivity. For fading channel, we show that noncoherent combining can be used. As a result, no channel state information (CSI) estimation is required. For over-the-air computation, the proposed approach takes advantage of random access, where the access probability is to encode the norm of local gradient vector (without using any additional bits) and the preamble is to encode the quantized normalized gradient vector.

Second, an efficient image classification method is proposed. It combines ERC-Forests and saliency maps very closely with the extraction of image information. For a given image, a classifier builds a saliency map online and uses it to classify the image. We show in several state-of-the-art image classification tasks that this method can speed up the classification process enormously. Finally, we show that the proposed ERC-Forests can also be used very successfully for learning distance between images. The distance computation algorithm consists of learning the characteristic differences between local descriptors sampled from pairs of same or different objects. These differences are vector quantized by ERC-Forests and the similarity measure is computed from this quantization.

The proposed algorithm, which is referred to as time-series active search, offers significantly faster search with sufficient accuracy. The key to the acceleration is an effective pruning algorithm introduced in the histogram matching stage. Through the pruning, the actual number of matching calculations can be reduced by 200 to 500 times compared with exhaustive search while guaranteeing exactly the same search result. Experiments show that the proposed method can correctly detect and locate a 15-s signal in a 48-h recording of TV broadcasts within 1 s, once the feature vectors are calculated and quantized.

Network security commonly relies on bit-level credentials that are easily replicated and exploited by hackers. Unauthorized access can be mitigated by physical layer (PHY) security measures that exploit device-dependent emission characteristics that are sufficiently unique to discriminate devices. RF distinct native attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprinting is a PHY-based security measure, which computes statistical features extracted from such device emissions. However, the RF-DNA fingerprints can be numerous, correlated, and noisy, therefore, a dimensional reduction analysis (DRA) via feature selection is, therefore, of interest. Device classification with DRA feature subsets is evaluated using a multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) classifier. Determining feature relevance from MDA was generally dismissed in prior RF fingerprinting work and is seldom considered in other applications. Here, the MDA feature relevance is revisited using a proposed eigen-based MDA loadings fusion (MLF) methodology. The MDA classification models are adopted and used to assess device identification (ID) classification and verification performance for both the authorized and unauthorized (rogue) devices using a claimed versus actual biometric methodology. Performance is compared for six DRA methods using: 1) a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; 2) one-way analysis of variance F-test statistics; 3) a Wilk's lambda ratio; 4) generalized relevance learning vector quantized-improved relevance; 5) randomly selected; and 6) the proposed MLF method. Quantitative and qualitative dimensionality assessment methods are compared and contrasted to establish upper bounds on the number of retained features. Experimentally collected ZigBee emissions are considered and ZigBee device classification and ID verification performance using DRA subsets are compared with a full-dimensional feature set. Results show that DRA via the proposed MLF method is superior and more robust than competing methods.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2561902","U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7464336","Classification;dimensional reduction;discriminant analysis;feature selection;F-statistic;Kolmogorov-Smirnov;loadings;multiple discriminant analysis;network security;physical layer;RF-DNA;verification;Wilk’s Lambda;ZigBee;Classification;dimensional reduction;discriminant analysis;feature selection;F-statistic;Kolmogorov-Smirnov;loadings;multiple discriminant analysis;network security;physical layer;RF-DNA;verification;Wilk’s Lambda;ZigBee","Fingerprint recognition;Zigbee;Radio frequency;Feature extraction;Performance evaluation;Security;Robustness","computer network security;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;identification technology;Zigbee","Wilk lambda ratio;F-test statistics;Kolmogorov-Smirnov test;biometric methodology;identification verification;identification classification;DRA;dimensional reduction analysis;statistical features extracted;RF-DNA fingerprinting;RF distinct native attribute fingerprinting;physical layer security;network security;IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee wireless devices;ZigBee device emissions;MDA loadings fusion methodology;multiple discriminant analysis;RF fingerprinting;feature selection","","83","","73","USGov","3 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use diffusion maps to automatically learn a semantic visual vocabulary from abundant quantized midlevel features. Each midlevel feature is represented by the vector of pointwise mutual information (PMI). In this midlevel feature space, we believe the features produced by similar sources must lie on a certain manifold. To capture the intrinsic geometric relations between features, we measure their dissimilarity using diffusion distance. The underlying idea is to embed the midlevel features into a semantic lower-dimensional space. Our goal is to construct a compact yet discriminative semantic visual vocabulary. Although the conventional approach using k-means is good for vocabulary construction, its performance is sensitive to the size of the visual vocabulary. In addition, the learnt visual words are not semantically meaningful since the clustering criterion is based on appearance similarity only. Our proposed approach can effectively overcome these problems by capturing the semantic and geometric relations of the feature space using diffusion maps. Unlike some of the supervised vocabulary construction approaches, and the unsupervised methods such as pLSA and LDA, diffusion maps can capture the local intrinsic geometric relations between the midlevel feature points on the manifold. We have tested our approach on the KTH action dataset, our own YouTube action dataset and the fifteen scene dataset, and have obtained very promising results.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-3992-8","10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206845","","Vocabulary;Videos;Computer vision;Mutual information;Linear discriminant analysis;Layout;Text categorization;Classification tree analysis;Testing;YouTube","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;vocabulary","semantic visual vocabulary learning;diffusion distance;generic visual vocabularylearning;pointwise mutual information;intrinsic geometric relations;semantic lower-dimensional space;discriminative semantic visual vocabulary;k-means;supervised vocabulary construction","","81","2","32","","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed metric comprises two main steps: coding error estimation and perceptual weighting of this error. Error estimates are computed in the transform domain, assuming that discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients are corrupted by quantization noise. The DCT coefficient distributions are modeled using Cauchy or Laplace probability density functions, whose parameterization is performed using the quantized coefficient data and quantization steps. Parameter estimation is based on a maximum-likelihood estimation method combined with linear prediction. The linear prediction scheme takes advantage of the correlation between parameter values at neighbor DCT spatial frequencies. As for the perceptual weighting module, it is based on a spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity function applied to the DCT domain that compensates image plane movement by considering the movements of the human eye, namely smooth pursuit, natural drift, and saccadic movements. The video related inputs for the perceptual model are the motion vectors and the frame rate, which are also extracted from the encoded video. Subjective video quality assessment tests have been carried out in order to validate the results of the metric. A set of 11 video sequences, spanning a wide range of content, have been encoded at different bitrates and the outcome was subject to quality evaluation. Results show that the quality scores computed by the proposed algorithm are well correlated with the mean opinion scores associated to the subjective assessment.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2010.2077474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580020","H.264;image quality;no-reference (NR) metric;parameter estimation;video quality","Discrete cosine transforms;Measurement;Quality assessment;Quantization;Maximum likelihood estimation;PSNR;Streaming media","discrete cosine transforms;image sequences;maximum likelihood estimation;video coding","no-reference quality assessment;H.264/AVC encoded video;advanced video coding;coding error estimation;discrete cosine transform;quantization noise;Cauchy probability density functions;Laplace probability density functions;parameter estimation;maximum-likelihood estimation method;subjective video quality assessment;video sequences","","75","","45","IEEE","20 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a data-driven algorithm for dynamic sleeping control called DeepNap. This algorithm uses a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn effective sleeping policies from high-dimensional raw observations or un-quantized systems state vectors. We propose to enhance the original DQN algorithm with action-wise experience replay and adaptive reward scaling to deal with the challenges in nonstationary traffic. We also provide a model-assisted variant of DeepNap through the Dyna framework for inferring and simulating system dynamics. Periodical traffic modeling makes it possible to capture the nonstationarity in real-world traffic and the incorporation with DQN allows for feature learning and generalization from model outputs.

The higher-layer nature of inter-domain routing requires us to review the whole routing process in order to maximize performance at low decision making cost, a clear case for fuzzy-set logic based algorithms. In order to probabilistically avoid shortage of resources, besides effectively computing the feasible paths for an incoming connection request, under uncertainty, these paths should be compared in terms of the negative impact in resource supply which may be caused by other connections. To do this, besides enriching the protocol with vectors of per-class shadow cost metrics, quantized using fuzzy-set theory, we used a subset-interactive autoregressive time-series predictor which is based on fuzzy measures to evaluate path costs under supply metrics that change over time. Moreover, as the connections we are dealing with are semi-permanent, we must take into account the connections lifetime.

The presented approach is to remove computational redundancy by reordering computation. The reordering problem is formulated using a graph in which vertices represent coefficients and edges represent resources required in a computation using the differential coefficient defined by the difference of the vertices joined by the edge. This interpretation leads to various methods for computation reduction for which simple polynomial run time algorithms are presented. It is shown that about 20% reduction in the number of add operations per coefficient can be obtained over the conventional multiplierless implementations.

Our main focus is on the case where the measurement vectors are unconstrained, and where x is exactly K-sparse, or the so-called general compressive phase retrieval problem. We introduce PhaseCode, a novel family of fast and efficient algorithms that are based on a sparsegraph coding framework. We show that in the noiseless case, the PhaseCode algorithm can recover an arbitrarily-close-toone fraction of the K nonzero signal components using only slightly more than 4K measurements when the support of the signal is uniformly random, with the order-optimal time and memory complexity of Θ(K).1 It is known that the fundamental limit for the number of measurements in compressive phase retrieval problem is 4K - o(K) for the more difficult problem of recovering the signal exactly and with no assumptions on its support distribution. This shows that under mild relaxation of the conditions, our algorithm is the first constructive capacity-approaching compressive phase retrieval algorithm: in fact, our algorithm is also order-optimal in complexity and memory. Furthermore, we show that for any signal x, PhaseCode can recover a random (1 - p)-fraction of the nonzero components of x with high probability, where p can be made arbitrarily close to zero, with sample complexity m = c(p)K, where c(p) is a small constant depending on p that can be precisely calculated, with optimal time and memory complexity. As a result, assuming that the nonzero components of x are lower bounded by Θ(1) and upper bounded by Θ(Kγ ) for some positive constant γ <; 1, we are able to provide a strong ℓ1 guarantee for the estimated signal x̂ as follows: ||x̂ - x||1≤ p||x||1(1+o(1)), where p can be made arbitrarily close to zero. As one instance, the PhaseCode algorithm can provably recover, with high probability, a random 1 - 10-7 fraction of the significant signal components, using at most m = 14K measurements. Next, motivated by some important practical classes of optical systems, we consider a“Fourier-friendly” constrained measurement setting, and show that its performance matches that of the unconstrained setting, when the signal is sparse in the Fourier domain with uniform support. In the Fourier-friendly setting that we consider, the measurement matrix is constrained to be a cascade of Fourier matrices (corresponding to optical lenses) and diagonal matrices (corresponding to diffraction mask patterns). Finally, we tackle the compressive phase retrieval problem in the presence of noise, where measurements are in the form of yi = |aiH x|2 + wi, and wi is the additive noise to the wi measurement. We assume that the signal is quantized, and each nonzero component can take Lm possible magnitudes and Lp possible phases. We consider the regime, where K = βnδ, δ ∈ (0, 1). We use the same architecture of PhaseCode for the noiseless case, and robustify it using two schemes: the almost-linear scheme and the sublinear scheme. We prove that with high probability, the almost-linear scheme recovers x with sample complexity O(K log(n)) and computational complexity Θ(LmL pn log(n)), and the sublinear scheme recovers x with sample complexity Θ(K log3(n)) and computational complexity Θ(Lm L p K log3(n)). Throughout, we provide extensive simulation results that validate the practical power of our proposed algorithms for the sparse unconstrained and Fourier-friendly measurement settings, for noiseless and noisy scenarios.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2017.2693287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7896560","Phase retrieval;compressive sensing;coding theory;sparse-graph codes","Phase measurement;Complexity theory;Extraterrestrial measurements;Optical diffraction;Optical variables measurement;Sparse matrices;Noise measurement","codes;compressed sensing;computational complexity;Fourier analysis;graph theory","computational complexity;Fourier matrices;Fourier domain;compressive phase retrieval algorithm;memory complexity;order-optimal time complexity;compressive sensing;complex signal;sparse-graph codes;PhaseCode","","28","","49","USGov","12 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the absence of full channel knowledge at the transmitter, a quantized beamforming vector can be made available to the transmitter using a low-rate feedback channel, called limited feedback. A codebook based quantization approach is considered. Based on metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio and outage probability, maximization of the minimum distance between any pair of codewords has already been proposed as a codebook design criterion. An upper bound on the average SNR achieved by an optimal codebook designed using such a criterion is derived as a function of the feedback rate. This analysis quantifies the impact of the feedback rate and the number of transmit and receive antennas on the performance of the system.","","0-7803-8720-1","10.1109/ITW.2004.1405338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405338","","Upper bound;Feedback;MIMO;Array signal processing;Diversity reception;Transmitters;Quantization;Signal to noise ratio;Signal design;Performance analysis","array signal processing;MIMO systems;diversity reception;transmitting antennas;antenna arrays;receiving antennas;feedback;minimax techniques;probability","upper bound;SNR;limited feedback beamforming systems;MIMO systems;wireless systems;diversity;array gain;transmit beamforming;receive combining;low-rate feedback channel;codebook based quantization;signal-to-noise ratio;outage probability;minimum distance maximization;multiple-input multiple-output systems;optimal codebook;transmit antennas;receive antennas;performance","","12","","14","","14 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The coding gain of the entire family, with optimal bit allocation, is equal to that of the KLT and the PLT. Even though the original PLT introduced by Phoong is not applicable for vectors that are not blocked versions of scalar wide sense stationary processes, the GTD-based family includes members that are natural extensions of the PLT, and therefore also enjoy the so-called MINLAB structure of the PLT, which has the unit noise-gain property. Other special cases of the GTD-TC are the geometric mean decomposition (GMD) and the bidiagonal decomposition (BID) transform coders. The GMD-TC in particular has the property that the optimum bit allocation is a uniform allocation; this is because all its transform domain coefficients have the same variance, implying thereby that the dynamic ranges of the coefficients to be quantized are identical.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2031733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233910","Bit allocation;generalized triangular decomposition;geometric mean decomposition;linear prediction;majorization;Schur convexity","Transform coding;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Bit rate;Context;Dynamic range;Autocorrelation;Matrix decomposition;Quantization;Decorrelation;Councils","Karhunen-Loeve transforms;transform coding","generalized triangular decomposition;transform coding;optimal transform coders;Karhunen-Loeve transform;prediction-based lower triangular transform;optimal bit allocation;scalar wide sense stationary processes;GTD-based family;MINLAB structure;unit noise-gain property;GTD-TC;geometric mean decomposition;bidiagonal decomposition transform coders;optimum bit allocation;transform domain coefficients;linear prediction;Schur convexity","","11","2","29","IEEE","9 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This coder is proposed as a solution to improve the compression performance of spatial scalability and at the same time to reduce the high bit rate consumption of the base layer. In this system, the temporal subbands are generated by a novel approach called MC DCT temporal filtering (MCDCT-TF). The temporal subbands are further spatially decomposed using two-dimensional (2-D) DCT decimation technique . The generated spatio-temporal subbands are then quantized, entropy encoded, and transmitted along with the motion vectors. Several experiments are carried out on various image sequences to test the performance of the proposed coding scheme. The simulation results show that its performance exceeds that of H263+ single layer, spatial and spatio-temporal scalable coders.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2005.858743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564122","Discrete cosine transform (DCT);H.263+;motion compensation;scalability;subband;video compression","Discrete cosine transforms;Video coding;Scalability;Bit rate;Codecs;Filtering;Two dimensional displays;Entropy;Image sequences;Testing","motion compensation;discrete cosine transforms;video coding;data compression;filtering theory;entropy codes;image sequences","spatio-temporal scalability;motion-compensation;3D subband video coding;DCT video coding;discrete cosine transform;temporal filtering;entropy codes;image sequences;video compression","","11","","32","","27 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm NLU is a mixed time scale stochastic algorithm, characterized by two different decreasing weight sequences associated with the consensus and innovation updates.

Unlike popular bag-of-words (BoW) scene descriptors that rely on a library of vector quantized visual features, our descriptor is based on a library of raw image data (e.g., visual experience shared by colleague robots, publicly available photo collections from Google StreetView), and directly mines it to identify landmarks (i.e., image patches) that effectively explain an input query/database image. The discovered landmarks are then compactly described by their pose and shape (i.e., library image ID, and bounding boxes) and used as a compact discriminative scene descriptor for the input image. We collected a dataset of single-view images across seasons with annotated ground truth, and evaluated the effectiveness of our scene description framework by comparing its performance to that of previous BoW approaches, and by applying an advanced Naive Bayes Nearest neighbor (NBNN) image-to-class distance measure.","1050-4729","978-1-4799-6923-4","10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139961","","Libraries;Visualization;Databases;Proposals;Robots;Buildings;Image recognition","Bayes methods;edge detection;image retrieval;natural scenes;software libraries;visual databases","image-based prior leveraging;single-view cross-season place recognition;compact discriminative scene descriptor;object appearance;raw image data library;visual experience;colleague robots;publicly available photo collections;Google StreetView;image patches;input query image;landmark shape identification;landmark pose identification;library image ID;bounding boxes;annotated ground truth;naive Bayes nearest neighbor image-to-class distance measure;NBNN image-to-class distance measure;input database image","","9","","25","","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Significant prior work has investigated highly compact place representations, sub-linear computational scaling and sub-linear storage scaling techniques, but have always involved a significant compromise in one or more of these regards, and have only been demonstrated on relatively small datasets. In this paper we present a novel place recognition system which enables for the first time the combination of ultra-compact place representations, near sub-linear storage scaling and extremely lightweight compute requirements. Our approach exploits the inherently sequential nature of much spatial data in the robotics domain and inverts the typical target criteria, through intentionally coarse scalar quantization-based hashing that leads to more collisions but is resolved by sequence-based matching. For the first time, we show how effective place recognition rates can be achieved on a new very large 10 million place dataset, requiring only 8 bytes of storage per place and 37K unitary operations to achieve over 50% recall for matching a sequence of 100 frames, where a conventional stateof-the-art approach both consumes 1300 times more compute and fails catastrophically. We present analysis investigating the effectiveness of our hashing overload approach under varying sizes of quantized vector length, comparison of near miss matches with the actual match selections and characterise the effect of variance re-scaling of data on quantization.

On the other hand, in a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, feedback from the users is required to obtain transmit CSI. In this case, we assume the transmit CSI consists of a quantized version of the normalized estimated channel vector and the statistics of the channel norm of each user.

As an alternative to radio-based localization methods, in 2011, we introduced MoVIPS (Mobile Visual Indoor Positioning System), which is based on the idea to extract visual feature points from a query image and compare them to those of previously collected geo-referenced images. The general feasibility of positioning by SURF points on a conventional smartphone was already shown in our previous work. However, the system still faced several shortcomings concerning real-world usage such as request times being too high and distance estimation being unreliable because of the employed estimation method not being rotation invariant. In this paper, three extensions are presented that improve the practical applicability of MoVIPS. To speed up request times, both a dead reckoning approach (based on step counting using the accelerometer) and an orientation estimation (based on the smartphones compass) are introduced to filter relevant images from the database and thus to reduce the amount of images to compare the query image to. Furthermore, the vectors of the SURF points are quantized. For this purpose, clusters are calculated from all SURF points from the database. As a result, each image can be represented by a histogram of cluster frequencies, which can be compared with each other a lot more efficiently. The third extension is an improvement of the distance estimation method, which uses the matched feature points of an image to perform a perspective transformation and to determine the actual position with the aid of the transformation matrix.","","978-1-4673-8054-6","10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275472","","Visualization;Databases;Estimation;Feature extraction;Histograms;Vocabulary;Accuracy","feature extraction;image filtering;image matching;indoor navigation;mobility management (mobile radio);smart phones","location-based service;cost-effective indoor positioning method;MoVIPS;mobile visual indoor positioning system;visual feature extract;georeferenced image collection;SURF points;smartphone;dead reckoning approach;orientation estimation;image filtering;distance estimation method;image matching;transformation matrix","","5","","28","","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work tackles optimal quantizer design of the speech cepstral features (MFCCs) for such systems. The problem is posed as the minimization of loss of log-likelihood ratio between the quantized and unquantized speech features. First we show that the conventional mean squared error (MSE) quantizer for the top-scoring UBM Gaussian is optimal under practical assumptions.

These systems involve the quantized interactions of electromagnetic fields with large coherent collections of charges in superconductors, and so are typically referred to as macroscopic circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) devices or simply circuit QED devices. Although significant progress has been made recently, substantial engineering efforts are required to improve performance and scale these devices so they can address problems of practical interest. Performing these engineering efforts is difficult due to the absence of rigorous numerical modeling approaches. This work begins to address this by providing a new mathematical description of a commonly used circuit QED system, a transmon qubit coupled to microwave transmission lines. Expressed in terms of three-dimensional vector fields, our new model is better suited to developing rigorous numerical solvers than approximate lumped element circuit descriptions used in the literature. We present details on the quantization of our model, and derive equations of motion for the coupled field-transmon system. These results can be used in developing full-wave solvers in the future. To make this work more accessible, we assume a limited amount of training in quantum physics and provide many background details.","2379-8793","","10.1109/JMMCT.2021.3112808","NSF ECCS(grant numbers:169195); Purdue University; Distinguished Professorship Grant at Purdue University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540257","Circuit quantum electrodynamics;computational electromagnetics;quantum mechanics","Josephson junctions;Qubit;Integrated circuit modeling;Numerical models;Superconducting microwave devices;Junctions;Mathematical model","electromagnetic fields;quantum computing;quantum electrodynamics","superconducting circuits;quantum information processing hardware;electromagnetic fields;macroscopic circuit quantum electrodynamics;substantial engineering efforts;rigorous numerical modeling approaches;circuit QED system;coupled field-transmon system;quantum physics;lumped element circuit descriptions;numerical solvers","","3","","43","IEEE","16 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A low-complexity scheme is proposed for joint scheduling and beamforming, which employs feedback in the form of quantized channel directions and lower bounds on each user's received SINR, given a maximum orthogonality factor epsi between transmit beamforming vectors (epsi = 0 if orthogonal beamforming). The authors assume a simple power allocation, which consists of distributing the available power equally over the active beams. In a system with K active users and a given average SNR, the authors show that the sum rate is a function of the number of antennas, the number of active beams (considered less than or equal to the number of antennas), the orthogonality factor epsi and the quantization codebook size. A practical rate function is derived for the described system which approximates the average sum rate accurately as validated through computer simulations. Based on the proposed rate function, optimality of SDMA vs. TDMA systems with asymptotically large number of users is shown.

Then, we focus on obtaining high-precision preserved matches for fine-grained retrieval. This is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation of a Bayesian model with latent variables indicating whether matches in the putative set are inliers or outliers. We impose the non-parametric global geometrical constraints on the correspondence using Tikhonov regularizers in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The problem is solved by using the Expectation Maximization algorithm.

Under this assumption, the recovery performance of the popular Generalized Lasso (G-Lasso) is by now well-established. In this paper, we extend these types of results to the practically relevant settings with quantized measurements. We study two extremes of the quantization schemes, namely, uniform and one-bit quantization; the former imposes no limit on the number of quantization bits, while the second only allows for one bit. In the presence of a uniform dithering signal and when measurement vectors are sub-gaussian, we show that the same algorithm (i.e., the G-Lasso) has favorable recovery guarantees for both uniform and one-bit quantization schemes. Our theoretical results, shed light on the appropriate choice of the range of values of the dithering signal and accurately capture the error dependence on the problem parameters. For example, our error analysis shows that the G-Lasso with one-bit uniformly dithered measurements leads to only a logarithmic rate loss compared to the full- precision measurements.","","978-1-5386-6596-1","10.1109/ALLERTON.2018.8636051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636051","","Quantization (signal);Noise measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Error analysis;Loss measurement;Q measurement;Geometry","Gaussian processes;quantisation (signal)","sub-gaussian observations;dithered quantization;structured signal recovery;Generalized Lasso;dithering signal","","1","","25","","7 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the existing algorithms are not robust, thus failing to decrypt under packet loss. To further improve the robustness capability of video protection, a robust selective encryption scheme is proposed in this paper. In H.265/HEVC standard, video is encoded into multiple slices, and the slices are decoded independently. Inspired by the feature, each slice is individually encrypted using RC4 stream cipher. The pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) for one slice is related to encoding parameters and the SHA-256 hash value of the corresponding slice header, thus ensuring the real-time update of the PRBS and increasing the resistance to chosen-plaintext attack. A two-rounds shifting algorithm is designed to scramble non-zero coefficients of the transform units (TUs), and then motion vector difference (MVD) parameters, quantized transform coefficients (QTCs) and intra prediction modes (IPMs) are selected for encryption. The combination of coefficient scrambling and syntax elements encryption further improves the encryption performance. The proposed scheme is slice-synchronized. Hence, it decrypts normally in the case of packet loss, and supports online real-time interaction. Furthermore, the simulation and analysis results show that the proposed algorithm has format compatibility, high security and low time complexity, which is a promising tool for video cryptographic applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3210132","Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission: Key Projects of Stable Funding for Universities(grant numbers:WDZC20200818121348001); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission: Sustainable Development Project(grant numbers:KCXFZ202002011010487); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission: Shenzhen-Hong Kong Innovation Circle(grant numbers:SGDX2019091810120169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9903590","H.265/HEVC video;robustness;selective encryption;SHA-256","Encryption;Streaming media;Encoding;Syntactics;Ciphers;Robustness;Real-time systems","","","","","","","CCBYNCND","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To combat the inevitable speech quality deterioration resulting from the loss of transmitted packets of speech information, techniques that provide estimates of the lost information that is needed by the speech recovery process are of considerable interest. Furthermore, in future VoIP systems employing LPC based speech coders, a significant percentage of the coded speech information will represent the values of LPC coefficients and thus a new probabilistic approach for estimating missing LPC filter coefficients is presented in this paper. This approach employs a new formulation of LSP recovery system architecture where dependent-multiple Hidden Markov Models with Discrete Densities (DM-HMM-D) operate in parallel. Each HMM processes sequences of received quantized vectors of LSP coefficients and, while allowing for the modeling of the interdependencies that exist between LPC coefficients, resulting maximum likelihood observation probabilities are used to provide the required estimates of missing LSPs. The proposed missing parameters estimation technique is generic and initial experimental results demonstrate its considerable potential in improving the quality of LPC based decoded speech in VoIP applications).","","0-7803-9283-3","10.1109/ICICS.2005.1689031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1689031","Hidden Markov Models;VoIP systems;LSP coefficient recovery","Linear predictive coding;Speech processing;Hidden Markov models;Real time systems;Propagation losses;Information filtering;Information filters;Maximum likelihood estimation;Parameter estimation;Maximum likelihood decoding","filtering theory;hidden Markov models;Internet telephony;linear predictive coding;maximum likelihood decoding;probability;speech coding","Hidden Markov Models;VoIP systems;LSP coefficient recovery","","","","10","","11 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose computationally efficient optimization algorithms with convergence rates matching the information-theoretic performance lower bounds for: (i) Smooth and Strongly-Convex objectives with access to an Exact Gradient oracle, as well as (ii) General Convex and Non-Smooth objectives with access to a Noisy Subgradient oracle. The crux of these algorithms is a polynomial complexity source coding scheme that embeds a vector into a random subspace before quantizing it. These embeddings are such that with high probability, their projection along any of the canonical directions of the transform space is small. As a consequence, quantizing these embeddings followed by an inverse transform to the original space yields a source coding method with optimal covering efficiency while utilizing just R-bits per dimension. Our algorithms guarantee optimality for arbitrary values of the bit-budget R, which includes both the sub-linear budget regime (R<1), as well as the high-budget regime (R≥1), while requiring O(n2) multiplications, where n is the dimension. We also propose an efficient relaxation of this coding scheme using Hadamard subspaces that requires a near-linear time, i.e., O(nlogn) additions.

In this WSAN model there is a weight associated to each sensor-actuator link denoting the importance of that communication link to the actuation fidelity. These weights were shown to be useful in pruning away communication links to reduce the number of active channels. Inspired by recent work in power scheduling for decentralized estimation, we investigate the optimal allocation of system resources for achieving a desired actuation fidelity. In this scheme, each sensor acquires a noisy observation and sends a message to a subset of actuators using an MQAM transmission strategy. The message sent on each sensor-actuator communication link is quantized with a variable number of bits, with the number of bits optimized to minimize the total network power consumption subject to a constraint on the actuation distortion. We show analytically and verify through simulation that performing this optimal power scheduling can yield significant power savings over communication strategies that use a fixed number of bits on each communication link.","","978-1-59593-638-7","10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4379707","Design;Algorithms;Wireless sensor and actuator networks;power scheduling;optimization;frame theory","Wireless sensor networks;Actuators;Sensor fusion;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Scheduling;Information processing;Energy conservation","telecommunication links;wireless sensor networks","power scheduling;wireless sensor and actuator network;communication link;actuation fidelity;optimal allocation;system resources;MQAM transmission strategy;network power consumption;frame theory","","","","25","","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Beam Shaping for Massive MIMO Systems with One-bit Spatial $\Sigma -\Delta$ ADCs","W. Du; Z.

The spatial $\Sigma -\Delta$ structure is one important manner that can recover the amplitude information from one-bit quantized signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that the upper bound of the spatial degree of quantization noise reduction (DQNR) is 3 for the considered spatial $\Sigma -\Delta$ structure. However, the upper bound is hard to be achieved via the zero forcing (ZF) or the maximum ratio combination (MRC) schemes, and the achieved spatial DQNR is even not greater than 1 in the worst case. Thus the distortion suppression is inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a random beam shaping (RBS) scheme and prove it can achieve the spatial DQNR of 3. Through the random beam shaping, the beams are smeared into the whole beamspace. Meanwhile, the random beam shaping results in the power leakage of the beams and it may limit the distortion suppression when considering the additive noise. To reduce the power leakage, we further propose an accurate beam shaping (ABS) scheme, in which the vector for the beam shaping is optimized through the alternative minimization algorithm and the beams are concentrated around the region with low power of quantization noise. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed beam shaping schemes can more efficiently exploit the large-scale antenna array to recover the amplitude information.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3208064","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171345); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9896168","One-bit quantization;amplitude distortion;massive MIMO;spatial  $\Sigma -\Delta$  ADCs;degree of quantization noise reduction (DQNR)","Quantization (signal);Distortion;Antenna arrays;Antennas;Signal to noise ratio;Massive MIMO;Channel models","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The resultant distribution can then be sampled to generate likely completions, each exhibiting plausible shape details while being faithful to the input. To facilitate the use of transformers for 3D, we introduce a compact 3D representation, vector quantized deep implicit function (VQDIF), that utilizes spatial sparsity to represent a close approximation of a 3D shape by a short sequence of discrete variables. Experiments demonstrate that ShapeFormer outperforms prior art for shape completion from ambiguous partial inputs in terms of both completion quality and diversity. We also show that our approach effectively handles a variety of shape types, incomplete patterns, and real-world scans.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-6946-3","10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.00614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878566","3D from multi-view and sensors; Representation learning; Vision + graphics","Point cloud compression;Computer vision;Three-dimensional displays;Limiting;Shape;Computer architecture;Diversity methods","feature extraction;image reconstruction;image representation;solid modelling","ShapeFormer;transformer-based shape completion;sparse representation;transformer-based network;object completions;point clouds;resultant distribution;exhibiting plausible shape details;transformers;compact 3D representation;deep implicit function;ambiguous partial inputs;completion quality;shape types","","","","73","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To synthesize expressive speech, the prosody of the speech has to be modeled, and predicted/controlled during synthesis. However, intuitive control over prosody remains elusive. Some techniques only allow control over the global style of the speech and do not allow fine-grained adjustments. Other techniques create fine-grained prosody embeddings, but these are difficult to manipulate to obtain a desired speaking style. We thus present ConEx, a novel model for expressive speech synthesis, which can produce speech in a certain speaking style, while also allowing local adjustments to the prosody of the generated speech. The model builds upon the non-autoregressive architecture of FastSpeech and includes a reference encoder to learn global prosody embeddings, and a vector quantized variational autoencoder to create fine-grained prosody embeddings. To realize prosody manipulation, a new interactive method is proposed. Experiments on two datasets show that the model enables multi-level prosody control.","2379-190X","978-1-6654-0540-9","10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9746654","speech synthesis;text-to-speech;prosody;controllability;hierarchical prosody embedding","Conferences;Natural languages;Signal processing;Predictive models;Speech;Acoustics;Speech synthesis","interactive systems;speech coding;speech synthesis","text-to-speech models;highly natural speech;intuitive control;speech synthesis;generated speech;global prosody embeddings;prosody manipulation;interactive multilevel prosody control;fine grained prosody embeddings;fine grained adjustments;expressive speech synthesis;TTS models;ConEx","","","","31","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Initially, the cover image is applied with integer wavelet transform (IWT) and later the whole image partitioned into $4 \times 4$ blocks. After this, the Hadamard transform (HT) is applied for obtaining transform coefficients. The first three pixel intensities in the first rows of each $4 \times 4$ block HT coefficients are quantized with the watermark coefficients. These three-pixel intensities are randomized with a vector, and the threshold parameters are obtained from GWO. When these optimized parameters applied, and the GWO algorithm improves the transparency. The results show the proposed algorithm has high imperceptibility and robust to attacks than existing works in literature.","","978-1-6654-1836-2","10.1109/GCAT52182.2021.9587641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9587641","Integer wavelet transforms Hadamard Transform;GWO;SSIM;NCC","Wavelet transforms;Bridges;Image color analysis;Watermarking;Gray-scale;Robustness;Optimization","genetic algorithms;Hadamard transforms;image watermarking;wavelet transforms","robust blind watermarking;integer wavelet transform;Hadamard transform;gray wolf optimization algorithm;transform coefficients;4 ×4 block HT coefficients;watermark coefficients;three-pixel intensities;GWO algorithm;image partitioning","","","","24","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional coding method, i.e. H.264 Intra coding is chosen to compress the key frame and the reconstructed frames are used for side information (SI). For one GOP, we acquire differences between the SI of key frame and eight Wyner-Ziv frames. Then, we utilize the CS to compress those differences in the temporal direction to obtain one compressive sensing depth differences (CSDD). The CSDD is quantized by our product vector quantizer based on GMM. At decoder, we reconstruct Wyner-Ziv frames and merge the key frame to form output videos. Experiment results show that our method is regarded as an effective coding method.","","978-1-7281-1312-8","10.1109/CAC.2018.8623451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8623451","Gaussian mixture models;compressive sensing;side in/ormation;depth video coding","Decoding;Channel coding;Video coding;Compressed sensing;Signal processing algorithms;Covariance matrices","compressed sensing;Gaussian processes;image sequences;mixture models;video coding","Gaussian mixture models;original depth video coding method;depth video sequences;GOP;Wyner-Ziv frames;conventional coding method;H.264 Intra coding;reconstructed frames;compressive sensing depth differences;output videos;effective coding method;distributed depth video coding;GMM;CSDD","","","","15","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
