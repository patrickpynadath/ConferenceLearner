Although several heuristic defenses are proposed to enhance the robustness of federated learning, they do not provide certifiable robustness guarantees. In this paper, we incorporate randomized smoothing techniques into federated adversarial training to enable data-private distributed learning with certifiable robustness to test-time adversarial perturbations. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that such an advanced federated adversarial learning framework can deliver models as robust as those trained by the centralized training. Further, this enables training provably-robust classifiers to2 bounded adversarial perturbations in a distributed setup. We also show that the one-point gradient estimation-based training approach is $2 - 3 \times$ faster than the popular stochastic estimator-based approach without any noticeable certified robustness differences.","2155-6814","978-1-6654-4935-9","10.1109/MASS52906.2021.00032","U.S. Department of Energy; Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637757","federated learning;certifiable robustness;randomized smoothing;adversarial training;gradient estimation","Training;Performance evaluation;Computer aided instruction;Smoothing methods;Distance learning;Perturbation methods;Stochastic processes","certification;computer crime;data privacy;distributed processing;estimation theory;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;random processes;stochastic processes","certifiably-robust federated adversarial learning;adversarial attacks;randomized smoothing;federated adversarial training;test-time adversarial perturbations;data-private distributed learning;L2-bounded adversarial perturbation;one-point gradient estimation-based training;stochastic estimator;provably-robust classifier training","","","","18","IEEE","13 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we present a previously unrecognized threat to robust machine learning models that highlights the importance of training-data quality in achieving high certified adversarial robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel bilevel optimization based data poisoning attack that degrades the robustness guarantees of certifiably robust classifiers. Unlike other poisoning attacks that reduce the accuracy of the poisoned models on a small set of target points, our attack reduces the average certified radius (ACR) of an entire target class in the dataset. Moreover, our attack is effective even when the victim trains the models from scratch using state-of-the-art robust training methods such as Gaussian data augmentation[8], MACER[36], and SmoothAdv[29] that achieve high certified adversarial robustness. To make the attack harder to detect, we use clean-label poisoning points with imperceptible distortions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by poisoning MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and training deep neural networks using previously mentioned training methods and certifying the robustness with randomized smoothing. The ACR of the target class, for models trained on generated poison data, can be reduced by more than 30%. Moreover, the poisoned data is transferable to models trained with different training methods and models with different architectures.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-4509-2","10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01304","Research and Development; U.S. Department of Energy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9578901","","Training;Deep learning;Smoothing methods;Toxicology;Perturbation methods;Distortion;Robustness","deep learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification","randomized smoothing based defenses;certifiably robust classifiers;test-time attacks;robust machine learning models;training-data quality;novel bilevel optimization based data poisoning attack;robustness guarantees;poisoning attacks;poisoned models;target points;entire target class;robust training methods;Gaussian data augmentation;certified adversarial robustness;clean-label poisoning points;generated poison data;poisoned data","","1","","37","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the second part of the paper, under an additional assumption of weak-sharpness, we update the stepsize sequence using a recursive rule that leverages problem parameters. The second contribution lies in showing that employing such a sequence, the extragradient algorithm possesses almost-sure convergence to the solution as well as convergence in a mean-squared sense to the solution of the problem at the rate O(1 over k). Motivated by the absence of a Lipschitzian parameter, in both schemes we utilize a locally randomized smoothing scheme.

Currently, the most prevalent algorithms for consensus maximization draw from the class of randomized hypothesize-and-verify algorithms, which are cheap but can usually deliver only rough approximate solutions. On the other extreme, there are exact algorithms which are exhaustive search in nature and can be costly for practical-sized inputs. This paper fills the gap between the two extremes by proposing deterministic algorithms to approximately optimize the maximum consensus criterion. Our work begins by reformulating consensus maximization with linear complementarity constraints. Then, we develop two novel algorithms: one based on non-smooth penalty method with a Frank-Wolfe style optimization scheme, the other based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Both algorithms solve convex subproblems to efficiently perform the optimization. We demonstrate the capability of our algorithms to greatly improve a rough initial estimate, such as those obtained using least squares or a randomized algorithm.

However, several studies showed that it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, an attacker can make a classifier predict an incorrect label for a 3D point cloud via carefully modifying, adding, and/or deleting a small number of its points. Randomized smoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image classifiers. However, when applied to 3D point cloud classification, randomized smoothing can only certify robustness against adversarially modified points.In this work, we propose PointGuard, the first defense that has provable robustness guarantees against adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and an arbitrary point cloud classifier, our PointGuard first creates multiple subsampled point clouds, each of which contains a random subset of the points in the original point cloud; then our PointGuard predicts the label of the original point cloud as the majority vote among the labels of the subsampled point clouds predicted by the point cloud classifier. Our first major theoretical contribution is that we show PointGuard provably predicts the same label for a 3D point cloud when the number of adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points is bounded. Our second major theoretical contribution is that we prove the tightness of our derived bound when no assumptions on the point cloud classifier are made. Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm to compute our certified robustness guarantees.

A line of work on tackling adversarial examples is certified robustness via randomized smoothing that can provide a theoretical robustness guarantee. However, such a mechanism usually uses floating-point arithmetic for calculations in inference and requires large memory footprints and daunting computational costs. These defensive models cannot run efficiently on edge devices nor be deployed on integer-only logical units such as Turing Tensor Cores or integer-only ARM processors. To overcome these challenges, we propose an integer randomized smoothing approach with quantization to convert any classifier into a new smoothed classifier, which uses integer-only arithmetic for certified robustness against adversarial perturbations. We prove a tight robustness guarantee under ℓ2-norm for the proposed approach. We show our approach can obtain a comparable accuracy and 4× ∼ 5× speedup over floating-point arithmetic certified robust methods on general-purpose CPUs and mobile devices on two distinct datasets (CIFAR-10 and Caltech-101).","2380-7504","978-1-6654-2812-5","10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9710138","Adversarial learning;Efficient training and inference methods","Smoothing methods;Program processors;Tensors;Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Neural networks;Robustness","","","","","","49","IEEE","28 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has attracted the attention of medical imaging community for several years. This work introduces a fully automated brain tumor segmentation approach from multimodal MRI images. Segmentation in three different MRI modalities; T1 (gadolinium-enhanced), T2, and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion-Recovery (FLAIR) are compared to choose the best one. The proposed approach utilizes a super-pixel over-segmentation technique and applying a classification for each super-pixel which leads to more smooth segmentation. Several features including statistical, fractal, and texture features are calculated from each super-pixel of the normalized (T1, T2, and flair) images to ensure a robust classification. Additionally, the class imbalance problem is tackled to allow the algorithm to accurately segment abnormal tissue. The Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm is utilized for final segmentation. The RF classifier is being chosen in the proposed approach because it provides a better performance according to the confusion matrix results. The proposed approach has been trained using 10 Low-Grade and 20 High-Grade cases and evaluated using different 5 Low-Grade and 5 High-Grade cases from BRATS 2013 dataset. Dice, average precision, sensitivity, and F1-score metrics are used for segmentation accuracy evaluation. The average precision, sensitivity, fl-score and dice overlap for tumor segmentation are 92%, 95%, 96% and 94% for flair images, 89%, 92%, 90% and 93% for T2 and 89%, 90%, 89% and 90% for T1. Finally, the voting strategy is being used to get the best segmentation between these different modalities.","","978-1-7281-8855-3","10.1109/ACIT50332.2020.9300122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300122","BRATS challenge;super-pixel segmentation;Extremely Randomized Tree (ERT);Feature selection and normalization;SMOTE-TOMEK","Tumors;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Fractals;Gabor filters;Radio frequency","biomedical MRI;brain;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;image texture;medical image processing;random forests;tumours","texture features;segment abnormal tissue;random forest classification algorithm;F1-score metrics;flair images;superpixel over-segmentation;medical imaging community;fully automated brain tumor segmentation approach;multimodal MRI images;MRI modalities;fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery;over-segmentation technique;smooth segmentation;statistical texture features;random forest classification","","1","","24","","4 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Identification and inversion of converted shear waves: case studies from the European North Atlantic continental margins","J. D. Eccles; R. S. White; P. A. F. Christie",NA; NA; NA,"Geophysical Journal International","18 Jan 2018","2009","179","1","381","400","Wide-angle shear wave arrivals, converted from compressional to shear waves at crustal interfaces, enable crustal Vp/Vs ratios to be determined which provide valuable constraint on geological interpretations. Analysis of the converted shear wave phases represents the next logical step in characterizing the crustal structure and composition following multichannel seismic structural imaging and tomographic inversion of the wide-angle compressional wave phases. In this offshore study across two passive margins extending from stretched continental to fully oceanic crust, the high-data density (2–10 km ocean bottom seismometer, OBS, spacing) and a consistent, efficient conversion interface produced shear wave data sets suitable for traveltime inversion. The shear waves were recorded by three orthogonal geophones in each OBS. Arrival phases, visible to 180 km offset, were identified using their arrival times, moveout velocities and particle motions. Across the North Atlantic volcanic rifted continental margins studied, breakup was accompanied by the eruption of large volumes of basalts of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. The interface between post-volcanic sediments and the top of the basalts provides the dominant conversion boundary across the oceanic crust and the continent—ocean transition. However, the shear wave data quality was significantly diminished at the continental ends of the profiles where the thick basalt flows and hence this conversion interface feathers out and crustal attenuation increases. Initial modelling of the converted shear wave phases was carried out using a layer-based approach with arrivals converted on the way up used to constrain the Vp/Vs ratio of the post-volcanic sedimentary sequence beneath each OBS. To produce a model with continuous crustal S-wave velocities, the compressional wave velocities beneath the sediment-top basalt interface were transformed into starting shear wave velocities using a constant value of Vp/Vs and the inversion carried out by specifying the appropriate ray path. Once the data set had been fully interpreted, correction of the traveltimes to effective symmetric ray paths enabled us to apply a regularized grid inversion. Such inversions are less subjective than the layer-based approach and yield more robust minimum structure results with quantifiable errors, except in the vicinity of a known subbasalt low-velocity zone encountered on the Faroes margin. Monte Carlo analyses were performed for this approach; the average model from multiple inversions using randomized starting models and traveltimes shows the structure required by the traveltimes and the model standard deviation gives an estimate of uncertainty. Model and inversion parametrizations were fully tested and optimum parameters chosen for compressional and shear wave inversions. This allows, after appropriate model smoothing, an estimate to be made of the spatial variation of the Vp/Vs ratio within the crust. There are marked gradients in Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs ratio across the continent—ocean transition, which may result from intrusion of high magnesium mafic igneous material into the crystalline continental crust. The Vp/Vs ratio, used in conjunction with Vp, also provides constraints on the subbasalt lithologies forming the low-velocity zone. We conclude from such an analysis that this zone is unlikely to be composed entirely of igneous hyaloclastite material; some proportion of clastic sedimentary rocks is likely to be present. The Vp/Vs and Vp properties of the units underlying the low-velocity zone are inconsistent with crystalline continental basement and this unit is likely to represent a sill-intruded Mesozoic sedimentary sequence from a pre-breakup sedimentary basin.","1365-246X","","10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04290.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8179844","Controlled source seismology;Body waves;Seismic tomography;Continental margins: divergent;Large igneous provinces;Atlantic Ocean","","","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The kernel spectral estimation method that is familiar, for the classical SSP estimation problem, with the Fourier transform operator and white noise in the observations is extended to incorporate spatial correlation in the data, the system-oriented model of the signal formation operator, and the maximum entropy (ME) statistical a priori information about the SSP. To derive the estimate of the SSP, we applied the Bayesian strategy for maximization of the a posteriori probability density function of the randomized ME model of the SSP. The estimator was obtained as a nonlinear adaptive algorithm that also permits a concise robust implementation. The optimal algorithm implies formation of the second-order sufficient statistics of the data and their smoothing by applying the window operator. The new formalism of the sufficient statistics and windows, explaining their adjustment to the metrics in a solution space, a priori nonparametric model and assumed correlation properties of the desired SSP, is developed. Simulation results are included to illustrate the overall performance of the proposed method in an example of application to radar image formation.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.801916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025594","","Power distribution;Bayesian methods;Entropy;Space power stations;Statistics;Estimation theory;Kernel;Fourier transforms;White noise;Probability density function","Bayes methods;remote sensing by radar;radar imaging;maximum entropy methods;spectral analysis;Fourier transforms;probability;adaptive estimation;nonlinear estimation;optimisation;statistical analysis","wavefield power distribution estimation;remotely sensed environment;Bayesian maximum entropy approach;random realization;remotely sensed signal;spatial spectrum pattern;wavefield sources;Bayesian estimation theory;kernel spectral estimation method;Fourier transform operator;white noise;spatial correlation;system-oriented model;signal formation operator;maximum entropy;statistical a priori information;a posteriori probability density function;nonlinear adaptive algorithm;optimal algorithm;second-order sufficient statistics;window operator;sufficient statistics;a priori nonparametric model;correlation properties;simulation results;radar image formation","","66","","24","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On-demand streaming with asynchronous requests and, in general, with VCR-like interactions nevertheless remains a challenging task in overlay networks. In this paper, we introduce the dynamic skip list (DSL), a novel randomized and distributed structure that inherently accommodates dynamic and asynchronous clients. We establish the theoretical foundations of the DSL and demonstrate a practical DSL-based streaming overlay. In this overlay, the costs for typical operations, including join, leave, fast-forward, rewind, and random seek, are all sublinear to the client population. The model also seamlessly integrates a smart data scheduling algorithm using linear network coding, yielding fast and robust downloading from multiple suppliers. Our simulation results show that the DSL-based overlay is highly scalable. It delivers reasonably smooth playback with diverse client interactivities while keeping the computation and bandwidth overheads low.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2007.70748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359437","Applications;Protocol architecture;Applications;Protocol architecture","Streaming media;Video recording;Peer to peer computing;DSL;Vehicle dynamics;Costs;Scheduling algorithm;Robustness;Collaboration;Indexing","media streaming;scheduling","dynamic skip list;on-demand media streaming;VCR interactions;media distribution;streaming overlay;smart data scheduling algorithm;linear network coding","","47","","38","","3 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approaching trail region is simply modeled as a circular arc of constant width. Using an adaptive measure of color and brightness contrast between a hypothetical region and flanking areas, the tracker performs a robust randomized search for the most likely trail region and robot pose relative to it with no a priori appearance model. Stereo visual odometry improves tracker dynamics on uneven terrain and permits local obstacle map maintenance. A motion planner is also described which takes the trail shape estimate and local map to plan smooth trajectories around in-trail and near-trail hazards. Our system's performance is analyzed on several long sequences with diverse appearance and structural characteristics using ground-truth segmentations.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-6676-4","10.1109/IROS.2010.5650189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5650189","","Tracking;Image color analysis;Cameras;Trajectory;Robot kinematics;Visualization","cameras;distance measurement;mobile robots;navigation;omnidirectional antennas;optical radar;path planning;position control;robot vision;stereo image processing","trail following;omnidirectional vision;autonomous outdoor robot navigation;stereo omnidirectional color camera;ladar based structural information;stereo visual odometry;local obstacle map;motion planner;trail shape estimation;trail hazard","","7","","30","","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a transmitter that transmits signals with different modulation types. A deep neural network is used at each receiver to classify its over-the-air received signals to modulation types. In the meantime, an adversary transmits an adversarial perturbation (subject to a power budget) to fool receivers into making errors in classifying signals that are received as superpositions of transmitted signals and adversarial perturbations. First, these evasion attacks are shown to fail when channels are not considered in designing adversarial perturbations. Then, realistic attacks are presented by considering channel effects from the adversary to each receiver. After showing that a channel-aware attack is selective (i.e., it affects only the receiver whose channel is considered in the perturbation design), a broadcast adversarial attack is presented by crafting a common adversarial perturbation to simultaneously fool classifiers at different receivers. The major vulnerability of modulation classifiers to over-the-air adversarial attacks is shown by accounting for different levels of information available about the channel, the transmitter input, and the classifier model. Finally, a certified defense based on randomized smoothing that augments training data with noise is introduced to make the modulation classifier robust to adversarial perturbations.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2021.3124855","U.S. Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-17-C-0090); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609969","Modulation classification;deep learning;adversarial machine learning;adversarial attack;certified defense","Receivers;Perturbation methods;Wireless communication;Modulation;Transmitters;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors","deep learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;signal classification;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","over-the-air received signals;transmitted signals;evasion attacks;broadcast adversarial attack;adversarial perturbation;modulation classifier;over-the-air adversarial attacks;channel-aware adversarial attacks;deep learning;deep neural network;certified defense;wireless signal classifiers","","2","","69","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
